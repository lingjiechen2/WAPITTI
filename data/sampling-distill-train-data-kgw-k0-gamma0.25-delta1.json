To a surprisingly great degree, the Revolutionary seditious and secret schemes were prefigured by the Anarchist tradition, specifically, by William Godwin, an extraordinarily important British figure of the mid-1700s, who wrote a Philosophical Rant called Political Justice, and, crucially, for us, An Enquiry Concerning Political Justice, first published in 1793. Thus, he argued for a suspension of all laws, courts, prisons and police in favour of a radically novel form of mutually supportive, uncoerced, self-regulating benevolence, handshaking agreement on a case-by-case basis, or word-of-mouth, trust-your-neighbours, take-it-as-received, embrace-and-empower, peer-to-peer, face-to-face, community-focussed, xenophobia-defusing, dignity-enhancing, boundless, fending-off of fascist plutocrats \u2014 sorry about that, very good!\nAt any rate, Godwin\u2019s contemporary John Oswald, an Anarchist from Edinburgh,"}

Deng had travelled from Liberia, where she recently volunteered, to join her father, William, for a four-week visit in Philadelphia. Deng, formerly of the Bronx, attended high school in Amagansett, New York, and embraced many of the city's artistic commodities, according to her mother, Sylvia. William Deng, a law professor, is on sabbatical from Princeton until December, and said he was in close contact with fellow academics about the need for medical monitoring for Ebola patients in Africa. It is unclear whether Deng contracted the virus from her father, who was hospitalised after displaying symptoms of the disease in Africa, or at another location.

These are two or more different views of the subject matter, rather like \"Modern Physics\" versus \"Classical Physics.\" So mostly there are only differences. But, for example, there may be differences between such views as \"Modern Physics\" and \"Religion\" or \"Esoteric Physics\" or \"Traditional Physics.\" The word \"religion\" is an omnibus term for \"Our Ultimate Concepts.\" It includes such primary concepts as \"God,\" \"The Universe,\" \"Existence,\" \"The Timeless Past,\" \"The Timeless Future,\" or \"The Meaning of Life.\" These are basic, omnipotent, topics which everyone discusses, and which everyone has always discussed, and these everyone is interested in.
