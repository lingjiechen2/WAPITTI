        "Cluster comprises IBM's Opteron-based eServer 325 server and systems management software and storage devices that can run Linux and Windows operating systems.\nIBM on Tuesday announced a prepackaged and pretested cluster that is powered by Advanced Micro Devices Inc.s 64-bit Opteron processor.\nIBM, of Armonk, N.Y., is combining its Opteron-based eServer 325 server\u2014which targets scientific and technical computing users\u2014with systems management software and storage devices to offer a bundled package that can run Linux and Windows operating systems.\nThe new offering, which will be available later this month or in early December, is part of IBMs eServer Cluster 1350, which also includes bundles based on the companys BladeCenter blade servers and two-processor x335 and x345 systems using Intel Corp.s 32-bit Xeon chips.\nClusters comprise multiple servers tied together to create a supercomputing environment for users. In a related move, IBM last week announced that it was teaming with Corning Inc., the U.S. Department of Energy and the National Nuclear Security Administration to develop high-speed, optically switched interconnects for supercomputers. The $20 million, two-and-a-half-year project is aimed at increasing network bandwidth by 50 times while at the same time cutting the costs of supercomputers.\nIBMs 325 systems, powered by 2GHz Opterons, give users a chance to run both their 32-bit and 64-bit applications on a single platform, which is important for mixed-use environments, said David Turek, vice president of IBMs Deep Computing unit.\n\"For many of these users, who have been left with a stark choice\u2014you either run 32-bit or 64-bit\u2014Opteron is an interesting bridge between the two,\" Turek said. \"Its an attractive proposition.\"\nAMD, of Sunnyvale, Calif., has pushed Opterons ability to run 32-bit applications as well as it does 64-bit applications as a key differentiator between it and Intels Itanium architecture. The 64-bit Itanium chip maintains a limited amount of backward compatibility, which means that it does not run the 32-bit applications as well as it does the 64-bit software.\nWith the latest Itanium 2 released this summer, officials with Intel, of Santa Clara, Calif., were promoting the companys IA-32 Execution Layer, designed to bridge that performance gap. Intel, which has pushed Xeon-based systems for 32-bit applications and Itanium for 64-bit computing, views the execution layer as a way of helping customers who want to move to 64-bit computing but still have older 32-bit applications running.\nOn Monday, Intel officials said that a software update from Microsoft Corp. that includes the execution layer for Windows applications has been delayed until the second half of next year. However, they said that Linux vendors, including Red Hat Inc. and SuSE Linux AG, both are incorporating the execution layer code in their offerings.\n/zimages/3/28571.gifRead \"MS Delay Hinders Itanium Software Upgrade.\"\nGordon Haff, an analyst with Illuminata Inc., said Opterons adoption path is mirroring that of the older Itanium technology.\n\"Theres a lot of interest in Opteron in [the high-performance computing space]; its nearly exclusively in HPC,\" said Haff, in Nashua, N.H. \"Its a good performing chip, and thats pretty much what HPC [customers are] looking for.\"\nWhile backward compatibility with 32-bit applications may make Opteron more attractive in the commercial space, HPC users are more interested in performance, he said.\nTurek agreed. \"The Intel name carries a lot of weight in the industry,\" he said. That said, HPC and technical computing customers tend to be among the early adopters of new technology.\n\"Theyre searching for the best technology without so much regard for the brand,\" he said.\nThe Opteron cluster offering includes IBM Cluster Management Software, which aims to avoid problems and speed up the resolution of problems that do occur by automating repetitive tasks and error detection.\nAlso included in the cluster package is a new Linux Cluster Install Tool, which automates much of the installation work, IBM officials said.\nIn the supercomputing interconnect project, Cornings Science & Technology Division, in Corning, N.Y., will create a prototype for an optically switched interconnect. IBM Research Labs in the United States and Switzerland will build the systems electronic control and monitoring circuitry.",

        "Marketers are employed in the public sector as well as the private sector.\nMost people think of marketing as a strictly private sector activity, but the reality is people with sales and marketing backgrounds are hired by government agencies in a number of capacities. Government agencies at the local, state and federal level all employ marketing professionals in areas including, but not limited to, public relations, property disposal, bond sales and purchasing.\nAlmost all major government agencies have their own public-relations staff, and in many cases it is a stand-alone department with a public relations or media director and several support staff. Government agency PR departments are responsible for producing news releases, holding press conferences, and generally promoting activities of the agency, such as tourism or encouraging new businesses to move into the area.\nGovernment agencies are constantly buying supplies, equipment and other property and selling off old equipment and property. The departments tasked with disposing of this government property often hire individuals with a background in marketing. Their job is to assist the agency in coming up with creative ways to sell or otherwise dispose of obsolete government property.\nMost government agencies have to follow complicated regulations for purchasing supplies and equipment. In many cases, agencies can only buy from certain suppliers or can only buy goods within specific price ranges. Agencies often hire purchasing agents with marketing backgrounds to help them manage their purchases, including setting criteria for suppliers and establishing price ranges. Government purchasing agents must be very familiar with current purchasing regulations at their agency.\nLocal, state and federal agencies sometimes sell bonds to finance capital improvement projects in their jurisdictions. These agencies hire bond and securities marketing specialists to prepare bond prospectuses for investors, which detail the terms of the bond, and to organize marketing campaigns to sell the bonds. Bond marketing specialists also typically manage media relations for bond campaigns.\nBrowne, Clayton. \"Are There Marketing Jobs in the Government?\" Work - Chron.com, http://work.chron.com/there-marketing-jobs-government-22921.html.

        "An eagerly awaited report from the World Health Organization (WHO) states that processed meats such as bacon and sausages cause cancer, and red meat likely does so too.\nThe France-based International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), part of the WHO, put processed meats on the top of their \u201cthings that cause cancer list\u201d, grouping them alongside tobacco, asbestos and diesel fumes, for which there is \u201csufficient evidence\u201d of cancer links.\nAlong the years, there have been many studies that linked processed and red meats with cancer (especially bowel cancer), but there were always some doubts floating about. Now, the 22-member panel analyzed animal experiments, studies of human diet and health, and cell mechanisms that could lead from these meats to cancer.\n\u201cThese findings further support current public health recommendations to limit intake of meat,\u201d Dr. Christopher Wild, who directs IARC, said in a statement.\nThe decision wasn\u2019t unanimous though, and a \u201cprobably\u201d still crept in to the report. Many studies show the links, both in populations of people and in tests that show how eating these foods can cause cancer, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) said in its report, released in the Lancet medical journal.\nThis could give you cancer. Photo by Niklas Rhose.\nMost reports on the links between meat and cancer have been softened with some element of doubt, but the IARC uses clear and direct language in saying processed meat causes cancer. There are no phrases such as \u201cmay cause\u201d in the report.\n\u201cOverall, the Working Group classified consumption of processed meat as \u2018carcinogenic to humans\u2019 on the basis of sufficient evidence for colorectal cancer,\u201d the report reads. \u201cAdditionally, a positive association with the consumption of processed meat was found for stomach cancer. The Working Group classified consumption of red meat as \u2018probably carcinogenic to humans\u2019,\u201d it added.\n\u201cThe experts concluded that each 50 gram portion of processed meat eaten daily increases the risk of colorectal cancer by 18 percent,\u201d the IARC said. \u201cFor an individual, the risk of developing colorectal cancer because of their consumption of processed meat remains small, but this risk increases with the amount of meat consumed,\u201d said IARC\u2019s Dr. Kurt Straif.\n\u201cRed meat refers to unprocessed mammalian muscle meat\u2014for example, beef, veal, pork, lamb, mutton, horse, or goat meat\u2014including minced or frozen meat; it is usually consumed cooked,\u201d the IARC said in its report.\nRed meat was included in a lower category, which means that while there is evidence for it causing cancer, there is still quite a lot of room for debate. But while processed meat seems to be decidedly bad for your health, not everybody is convinced about red meat.\nThe $95 billion U.S. beef industry has been preparing a retaliation for months, and they\u2019ve been rallying numerous scientists to their cause \u2013 even some unafililiated with the meat industry.\n\u201cWe simply don\u2019t think the evidence support any causal link between any red meat and any type of cancer,\u201d said Shalene McNeill, executive director of human nutrition at the National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association.\nFor now, the takeaway seems to be this: you need to stop eating processed meat. They have a number of damaging effects, including elevating stroke risk, raising cholesterol and, of course \u2013 cancer. If you absolutely can\u2019t give it up, then reduce it. Quantity does matter, and less is, while not ideal, better than more. The same goes for red meat \u2013 if you must have it, don\u2019t have it every day. It\u2019s not sustainable, it\u2019s bad for the animals, and it\u2019s bad for you.\nWe\u2019re getting to a point where science is starting to understand what\u2019s good for us and what\u2019s not. Let\u2019s make the science count, shall we?",

        "Was it a surprise to you that you were given the arts and culture position?\nNo, there is no surprise when you are a cadre of the ANC because you are deployed anywhere. You are given a five-year contract to do a portfolio and when you are finished, you wait for another one. At no stage do you have a say.\nWhat qualities do you bring to the position?\nPeople say to me you are a minister here but you can\u2019t sing; how can you survive in the sector? It\u2019s not about that.\nIf you attend some of the meetings of the ANC, you will see that I lead revolutionary songs. I know I can command a revolutionary song.\nI will be working with stakeholders and cultural activists and we will be going on a journey together. We will bring our understanding and our connection with young people.\nThis is an area that is, by and large, filled with practitioners who are young, with hopes for the future and dreams.\nWhat would be important would be to bring that strategic leadership to the sector, primarily to co-ordinate the endeavours that have been started by my predecessors.\nWhat are the first things you will tackle?\nOn my first day I had a briefing on what has happened in the department and what we need to do. I immediately raised the issue that we are writing the true history of South Africa through the voices of its people, rather than through colonialists.\nWe need a single national monument where everybody who comes to South Africa will be able to understand our history. It has to be brand- new. No nation has come through what we have come through without that kind of recognition and national monument.\nSouth Africa has a very rich history that needs to be taught properly. Things such as the Anglo-Boer War need to be taught fully, so that we would see that it was a South African war where everyone had a role. There is this strong feeling I have that it is important that we acknowledge all our history.\nOne thing we have to do is measure the contribution of arts to the big picture. Take for instance the yearly jazz festival in Cape Town. When people go there they talk about one aspect, which is tourism, but they forget that at the core it is arts and culture. They go there to connect spiritually with their needs. It is very important. I also want more people coming here to produce movies.\nI see arts as helping a young democracy that is competing with old democracies. We are still finding our way. I want to see South Africans being given an opportunity to reflect on themselves on a yearly basis. Heritage is very important because this is where we are grooming our people to understand [our cultural history]. By identifying young people and giving them a chance to study, we are creating a reservoir for the future.\nWe must also find a way of promoting all our languages. Some of them are seen as being inferior, which is a mistake. We also have to develop our unofficial languages, such as that of the amaPondo. When we develop them we are saying: \u2018We understand your culture, we know who you are and we want to see you prospering.\u2019 It is a huge task.\nWho do you listen to?\nI do not have a favourite because my point of view is that of an internationalist, where I listen to music from around Africa \u2013 Senegalese and Congolese music \u2013 and the world. I particularly enjoy jazz and soul. When I sit down to reflect and take stock I listen to jazz, and on a really bad day it is soul music. I like Richard Nwamba\u2019s African Connection [programme on SAfm]because it brings that music from across the continent. It\u2019s a pity that it is only once a week; I would like to have it during the week too.\nWe need to take better care of our artists. They entertain us and they become our celebrities, but in the end they die in very difficult circumstances. We need to improve their lives. They helped us to attain freedom and they are creating a new South Africa. Look at kwaito, which was an initiative of young people without anyone guiding them.\nDo the arts get enough financial support?\nI still have to see the fullness of the sector, but I would probably want arts to have more concentration in the sector. I am not sure it would only be financial. If you go to other countries, arts and culture are the things that unite people. They play a big role, like with sports and recreation.\nI am excited because of the potential that I feel we can unearth here. This is a junior department to others, but what can be more senior than leading a nation to identify itself? A nation that does not understand its soul is not worthy to be called a nation.\nAre there limits to freedom of expression? What about The Spear painting?\nOne area that we really fought for very hard is what is contained in the Bill of Rights: people have to express themselves. When you do that, you would be responsible and not express yourself to incite violence. When it comes to The Spear I can\u2019t say it is up to the minister to say what people must express. Whatever we do as a nascent demo-cracy, we must respect others.\nI\u2019m taking my point of view from the values of ubuntu, with the caring and sharing of Africans.\nBut other people have their own views.\nAre you going to any shows this weekend?\nI am going to the office as we speak for consultations, and I will still be doing that this weekend. Obviously I will be going to any events that I can, because you can\u2019t be something that you do not understand fully. It is one of the perks.\nWe have become a crass, materialistic society to the detriment of our most important needs \u2013 our spirits and our emotions. We cannot continue that way, because we are missing that sense of belonging.",
        "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew on Sunday warned Congress against manufacturing a crisis over federal spending in the months ahead, as looming deadlines set the stage for a repeat of the political deadlock which two years ago triggered worldwide financial market turmoil.\nIn coming negotiations with Republicans, who control the House of Representatives, Democratic President Barack Obama will focus on ways to create economic gains for the middle class over spending cuts, Lew said.\n\u201cWe have already done a lot of deficit reduction,\u201d he said in an interview on NBC. Lew spoke on four TV talk shows, setting out Obama\u2019s priorities ahead of an expected showdown this fall.\nBy early November, Congress must raise the legal limit on the country\u2019s borrowing authority or risk an unprecedented default on the government\u2019s debt.\nA debt ceiling showdown in August 2011 between Obama and congressional Republicans sparked wild stock market swings and cost the United States its top-tier AAA credit rating.\n\u201cWe need to get the debt limit extended in a way that doesn\u2019t create a crisis,\u201d Lew said.\nRepublicans see the debt ceiling as the their best leverage in winning a deal with Obama that would cut federal government spending to lower the deficit.\nLew, who was Obama\u2019s budget director in 2011, reiterated the president\u2019s stance that he would not consider short-term spending cuts, nor would he offset defense spending cuts with reductions in other government programs.\n\u201cThe president has made crystal clear, he\u2019s not going to negotiate over the debt limit,\u201d Lew said in an interview on ABC.\nThe debt ceiling is one of two fiscal deadlines facing Obama and Congress. By October 1, they must agree on a stop-gap measure to keep the government funded or face a shutdown.\nRepublicans have eyed this budget deadline as a way to roll back steep spending cuts for defense programs. But that is not an option, Lew said.\nCongress is scheduled to leave town August 2 for a five-week recess.\nAsked about the possibility of a federal response to Detroit\u2019s recent bankruptcy declaration, Lew threw cold water on any chances the struggling city will get federal aid.\n\u201cDetroit is going to have to work with its creditors on this,\u201d Lew told ABC.",

We generally have different tastes when it comes to TV, but this was a great show that we both liked. The final episode was great, and they were wrong to cancel it. However, I have seen what happens when you take a show about school and take it to far (Saved by the Bell: The College Years). I guess it is good they didn\u2019t go out like that.

        "In case you missed it, the initials ICYMI stand for the first five words of this sentence. In the event you have, indeed, missed it (ITEYH, I, MI has not taken off yet for some reason), it\u2019s most likely because you\u2019re not on the Internet much, particularly Twitter, where individuals and outlets deploy it every few seconds to bring links to the attention of others who may not have seen them. The New York Times now even has a section at the bottom of its app called \u201cIn Case You Missed It\u201d with articles from previous days.\nWhile the extended phrase has been used in conversation for a long time, the shorthand betrays an anxiety central to the Internet epoch. There is simply too much readable, viewable and listenable data for anyone to stay abreast of, as a humor piece, \u201cI\u2019m All Caught Up!\u201d by Nick Mickowski in McSweeney\u2019s, playfully suggested.\nWe used to receive media cyclically. Newspapers were published once (or sometimes twice) a day, magazines weekly or monthly. Nightly news was broadcast, well, each night. Television programs were broadcast on one of the major networks one night a week at a specific time, never to return until a rerun or syndication. Movies were shown first in theaters and on video much later (or, before the advent of VCRs, not until a revival). There were not many interstices, just discrete units \u2014 and a smaller number of them.\nNow we\u2019re in the midst of the streaming era, when the news industry distributes material on a 24-hour cycle, entire seasons of TV shows are dumped on viewers instantaneously, most movies are available at any time and the flow of the Internet and social media is ceaseless. We are nearly all interstitial space, with comparatively few singularities.\nThe cumulative effect is overwhelming for both producers of content and its consumers. Those who put out work, understandably, want to make sure it\u2019s not lost on whatever site is hosting it, let alone in the social media blizzard of \u201cmust read\u201d links, one-off jokes and other self-promotion. When the home page of a website refreshes every couple of hours (or minutes), there aren\u2019t a lot of conspicuous ways to showcase older material except through the referrals of Twitter, Facebook and the like.\nPre-Internet, we accepted that media had a mayfly\u2019s life span: Yesterday\u2019s news was yesterday\u2019s news, and that was it. If you were the creator of it, you made peace with the notion that people either saw it or didn\u2019t when it appeared, and you moved on; there was no alternative.\nIf it lingered in the public consciousness, it was because of its durability, not repeated reminders. Content had finite endings and deaths, not asymptotic approaches and long-term vegetative states from which resuscitation is always an option.\nNow, with just about every airing of a much greater number of shows obtainable at any moment, there is no excuse for missing one \u2014 and, therefore, a more urgent compulsion to catch up, in case you missed it.\nToday, both the outlets and the individuals who are responsible for the work are aware that they have a limited window in which their content can go viral and outlive its short stay on a home page. When it fails to do so, as, by definition, almost everything must, it may seem to them like a disheartening screen-age Zen koan: If an article about deforestation is published but no one clicks on it, did it actually exist?\nHence ICYMI. In an earlier time, the full verbal formulation meant that the recipient was supposed to see something of a certain degree of importance (a note, an email), and the sender was gently reminding you of its oversight.\nNow, the very shortening of the phrase is a byproduct and acknowledgment of the velocity of information against which its attached link is racing. The implication is that you probably have not seen it, and it\u2019s not necessary to your existence, but the sender would like to bring it to your attention anyway, please. It serves as a call of desperation as much as an announcement: Can you hear my whisper in these howling winds? In fact, ICYMI is often used as the second or third attempt to link to something (which suggests the content is not taking off organically) as a means of excusing the repetitive promotion.\nEven the Twitter account for President Obama, one of the few people who can assume that his actions are never missed by the world, occasionally uses ICYMI, especially to highlight achievements the White House may think are undervalued by the public, such as job growth and the Affordable Care Act.\nElissa Strauss, a columnist for TheWeek.com and a freelancer for a number of other Web publications, said that a financial incentive also drives Internet content creators who post their work multiple times (she said she typically \u201ctriple tweets\u201d each of her articles).\nGiven the near-infinite accessibility of digital media, it suggests that what Walter Benjamin called the unique, mystical \u201caura\u201d of an object of art in his seminal 1936 essay, \u201cThe Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,\u201d greatly diminished by the reproductive technologies of his time, is completely eradicated by ours.\nLive performances may be the last place to locate any sense of aura. Mr. Benjamin saw various reasons for optimism in the diminution of the aura. Reproduction, he posited, could emancipate us from cultlike reverence toward art and make us keener, more politicized critics. But nowadays it\u2019s pass\u00e9 to note that, during live events, people are often staring into their reproduction-friendly phones, perhaps a redirected form of ritual obeisance.\nAt least they can probably find a video or photo (maybe one they shot themselves) of what they were at later, in case they missed it.\nComing Soon: Sign up to receive our NYT Living newsletter, a weekly roundup lifestyle news from the Style, Travel, Food and Home sections delivered to your inbox.",

So far this year revenue has been essentially flat, although the value of the items that QVC is selling is down slightly.\nThe network generally offers one \u201cspecial value\u201d item to customers each day. For \u201cBlack Friday\u201d coverage, which starts at 8 p.m. EST on Thanksgiving, there will be three.\nEvery hour, there will be a specially priced offer, and there will be five hours of gifts that have never been available before on the network, QVC said.\nRival HSN, which has also been flat in sales this year, mailed one million gift guides for the first time to people who have bought things through the network in the past. It is also offering specially-priced items over the Thanksgiving weekend, although that\u2019s not a shift from what it has done in the past.\nHSN also had a \u201cGet Ready for the Holidays\u201d programming theme for the first week of November, for people who wanted advice on cooking and decorating. HSN has a little more than half QVC\u2019s sales domestically.\nJames, a former radio disc jockey, said the closest thing he\u2019s come to his upcoming 28-hour marathon is hosting radiothons for about half the time. He said he\u2019s working with a nutritionist to prepare him for the ordeal.\nHe\u2019s convinced his family to have an early Thanksgiving dinner and hopes the turkey will let him have a long nap before he goes to QVC\u2019s Pennsylvania studio.\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be coffee \u2014 a lot of coffee,\u201d he said.",

        "Occasional diarrhea is a common occurrence. Most people will experience an episode of diarrhea at least once or twice a year that will disappear in a couple of days.\nLuckily, there are many foods to eat that may help a person reduce the symptoms of diarrhea. There are also some foods to avoid when dealing with a bout of diarrhea, and some additional home care tips to consider.\nAnyone who is experiencing persistent diarrhea should see a doctor, as a person may become dehydrated over time.\nDiarrhea is a bowel movement that is more liquid than solid or has a loose texture. It is a common problem and may occur a couple of times each year. Diarrhea will usually last no more than 3 days.\nSoft, bland foods, such as toast, will help to absorb excess water and ease the symptoms of diarrhea.\nPeople with chronic digestive conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or Crohn's disease, may experience diarrhea more regularly.\nA person's diet is crucial if they are experiencing diarrhea. Some foods might help relieve symptoms of diarrhea while eating other foods can make diarrhea worse.\nWhile recovering from diarrhea, a person should eat bland, simple foods that are easy to digest and will help absorb some water from the stool.\nThese foods may be especially helpful on the first day of dealing with diarrhea. Eating many small meals throughout the day can help keep the digestive system from becoming overworked.\nProbiotic foods, such as yogurt and kefir, may help in some cases, but in others, probiotics may irritate the digestive system even more.\nProbiotics aid digestion by improving the balance of good and bad bacteria in the gut. However, dairy products can irritate the digestive system, so a person may wish to try non-dairy sources of probiotics, such as miso or sauerkraut.\nLiquids are also vital to recovery. People with diarrhea must drink plenty of water throughout the day and should drink an additional cup of water after every loose bowel movement.\nDrinking plenty of water helps prevent dehydration and flush any toxins out of the body.\nSoup broth will help to replace minerals and electrolytes lost because of diarrhea.\nSpicy ingredients can act as irritants in the digestive system. This is why people dealing with diarrhea should stick to bland foods, as they pose the least risk of agitating the digestive system.\nIt is not advisable to eat foods high in fat or oil when recovering from diarrhea. Added fats and oils from frying can be difficult for the sensitive digestive system to process and will likely make symptoms worse.\nA person can try eating boiled or steam vegetables and lean proteins instead.\nSugars that pass into the colon may disrupt the already sensitive bacteria there, making diarrhea worse. This includes fruit juices and high-sugar fruits.\nPeople with diarrhea should also avoid artificial sweeteners, as some can have a laxative effect.\nIt may also help to avoid too much fiber. Fiber helps keep the digestive system active. Usually, this is a good thing, but when the body is trying to recover from diarrhea, fiber may make symptoms worse.\nSoluble fibers, such as the pectin found in apples and bananas, can actually help a person recover from diarrhea, but a person should still try to limit their intake at least for the first day of symptoms.\nMany people experience diarrhea after drinking alcohol. Furthermore, some types of alcohol can be more likely to cause diarrhea than others. Learn more.\nCarbonated or fizzy drinks should be avoided, as they can irritate the digestive system and make the symptoms of diarrhea worse.\nCaffeinated beverages, such as coffee, tea, and soda, may overstimulate the digestive system and make symptoms worse.\nCarbonated drinks may also irritate or contribute to other symptoms, such as bloating and cramps. People should also avoid alcohol while dealing with diarrhea.\nWhile many sports drinks contain electrolytes that may help with dehydration, they often contain added sugars or artificial sweeteners. Coconut water or electrolyte-enhanced water are good alternatives.\nIn addition to following a diet that will help relieve diarrhea, there are several other remedies a person can take to make a swift recovery.\nOther diarrhea treatments include bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto Bismol) and Ioperamide (Imodium). These drugs can help relieve occasional cases of diarrhea and may be helpful to have on hand in a medicine cupboard.\nPepto Bismol and Imodium are available for purchase over-the-counter or online.\nPeople with diarrhea should also ensure they get enough rest, as putting the body in stressful situations while dealing with diarrhea may make matters worse.\nLimit physical activity while diarrhea symptoms are presenting, as strenuous activity may put the body at a greater risk of dehydration.\nHydration is also vital when managing diarrhea. Drink plenty of water throughout the day.\nClick here to learn more about treating diarrhea.\nBlood or mucus may appear in the stool in more serious cases of diarrhea. This is often accompanied by a fever and requires a visit to the doctor as soon as possible.\nUntreated diarrhea can also lead to serious complications, including dehydration. A person with severe diarrhea may require hospitalization and intravenous electrolytes.\nAnyone experiencing a fever of higher than 102\u00b0F or severe abdominal pains should visit a doctor.\nParents or guardians should carefully monitor any children with diarrhea. If symptoms do not clear up with 24 hours, they should call the doctor for guidance.\nAny additional symptoms should be reported to a doctor as soon as possible for diagnosis and treatment.\nMany cases of diarrhea last only a few days and respond well to home treatments. Eating a simple diet, increasing fluid intake, and using over-the-counter medications as necessary can help reduce symptoms quickly.\nIn cases where the body does not respond to these treatments after 2 or 3 days, a person should visit their doctor for diagnosis and treatment.\nJohnson, Jon. \"What foods to eat if you have diarrhea.\" Medical News Today.

        "Record low and negative interest rates in developed economies are fueling a ravenous search for yield that is forcing pension funds and other conservative institutional investors out of their comfort zones and into risky emerging markets, according to fund managers and analysts.\nThe reason for this has little to do with the attractiveness of EM investments. On the contrary, EM economic growth is at its lowest level since the 2008/09 financial crisis while the prospect of a U.S. monetary tightening creates the potential for financial turbulence.\nThe force propelling pension funds and insurance companies into unfamiliar EM investments is simple. If they stay at home, their investment returns are at risk of falling short of their liabilities.\n\"If you require, say, 5 percent a year in order to cover your insurance or pension liabilities, that is not available from developed market (debt) obviously,\" said Colm McDonagh, head of emerging market fixed income at Insight Investment.\nBrett Diment, head of emerging market debt at Aberdeen Asset Management, also sees a diversification into EM debt by pension and insurance companies. \"We are seeing a broader group of investors looking at the emerging market debt asset class, including some insurers and pension funds that have not looked before.\"\nMuch of this search for yield takes place behind the scenes, but it is not restricted to developed markets, where an estimated $1.7 trillion in bonds were offering negative yields last month. South Korea's state-run National Pension Service (NPS) announced this week that it would pour more than $40 billion into overseas equities and bonds over the next five years.\nThe NPS, which manages $483 billion and is the biggest investor in the Seoul market, had \"no choice\" but to look abroad for returns, according to the Korea Times, because domestic interest rates are low and set to fall further.\nPaolo Batori, global head of EM fixed income strategy at Morgan Stanley, foresees a fundamental shift in market dynamics. He said about 5 percent, or $80 billion, invested by insurance companies and pension funds in European government bonds would be switched into EM fixed income. Such an increase would roughly double the current exposure of such companies to emerging markets.\nMr. Batori uses the experience of Japanese life insurance companies after Japanese government bond yields declined in the aftermath of the financial crisis to reinforce his forecast. From the first quarter of 2009 to the third quarter of last year, Japanese life insurance companies increased their investments in foreign assets from just over 15 trillion yen to nearly 35 trillion yen as their search for yield intensified.\nBut where in EM should yield refugees from Europe go? In one sense, there is plenty of potential; emerging market countries account for around 40 percent of global GDP but only 14 percent of the global government bond market by value. And differences in yield are stark.\n\"In aggregate, (local currency emerging market debt) yields 6.5 percent \u2014 just above the average for the last five years, and a full 1.25 percentage points above the level preceding the May 2013 taper tantrum,\" said Denise Prime, an investment manager at GAM.\n\"With former safe havens looking so unappealing, local-currency emerging market debt is an attractive option for fixed-income investors,\" she added.\nBut, of course, yields such as these do not come without risk. One of the biggest concerns is that when the U.S. Federal Reserve tightens its monetary policy \u2014 though the timing for this is uncertain \u2014 funds could exit EM assets in favor of enhanced returns in the U.S.\nThe most vulnerable EM countries in such a scenario would be those that run hefty current account deficits and are therefore reliant on external financing. Such risks have been so well telegraphed that fund managers generally pursue a highly selective approach to EM assets.\nOne of the strategies deployed by investors to mitigate the risks of a strong dollar is to fund investments not by borrowing U.S. dollars but euro, which has depreciated or stayed steady against many EM currencies. In 2014, local EM currency bonds returned an average 7 percent against the euro and have returned 7.3 percent this year so far, according to Ms. Prime.\nIn a separate category, a large but relatively untapped opportunity lies in China. Some $1.5 trillion of the $4 trillion global market for EM local currency bonds is located within China's domestic market, accessible to foreign investors only through a tightly controlled quota system.\nBut for those investors able to access allocations, the returns can be attractive because of the higher interest rate environment in mainland China. The China Universal Enhanced Bond Fund, for example, returned 13.12 percent in 2014, according to China Universal, a Chinese asset manager.\n\"We are definitely seeing increasing interest from European investors, both retail and institutional, who are hunting for yield in a world that is not really delivering their return targets,\" said Christopher Gunns, a managing director at China Universal.\nBut, he notes that Chinese domestic debt stretches the comfort zone for some European investors. \"Among the institutional investors there are two things at play; a conservative risk budget competing with a need to generate returns.\"",

        "\"When it comes to fantasy sports and betting on NASCAR races, there&apos;s nothing wrong with it,\" Gaughan said.\n\"I wanted to go all in on gambling last year,\" NASCAR executive Steve O&apos;Donnell said.\n\"We have so many people that are linked to the cars. I think the integrity is a big piece to it,\" O&apos;Donnell said.\nNevada&apos;s effective monopoly on sports betting ended last spring, when the Supreme Court ruled the ban should be lifted. Casinos in seven other states \u2014 Rhode Island, Delaware, Mississippi, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and New Mexico \u2014 now accept wagers on sports. The list is expected to grow by next year with numerous states considering bills.\nAnd there&apos;s already a hitch that could slow bets: NASCAR this season has decided for the first time to strip drivers of victories if their cars are deemed illegal. There will be a roughly 90-minute inspection after the race and the winner will not be deemed official until the process is completed. Will fans really want to linger around the pay window another couple of hours just to cash in a ticket?\n\"The state&apos;s risk manager will delay any payout until NASCAR releases the official order of finish,\" Kirk said. \"Our casinos will receive an email reminding them of NASCAR&apos;s new procedures the week of Daytona.\"\nThe betting lines supplied by William Hill are set: Kevin Harvick and Kyle Busch are 5-1 favorites to win the 2019 Cup series championship. 2018 champ Joey Logano checks in at 7-1. For Sunday&apos;s Daytona 500, Harvick has 15-2 odds, Logano is at 8-1 and Brad Keselowski is also at 8-1 to win \"The Great American Race.\"\n\"The rules are in place,\" Hensley said, \"but you can&apos;t legislate human behavior.\"",
        "The day Jeff Deardorff has been waiting a lifetime for has arrived.\nMajor League Baseball's annual amateur draft begins today and, by all expectations, Deardorff shouldn't have to wait long for his phone to ring.\nThe most pessimistic of scenarios would have him being taken in the fifth round. The most optimistic is a first round selection. Most likely, though, the call could come sometime during the second or third rounds.\nBaseball America has projected Deardorff, who graduated from South Lake High School Friday, as the 54th overall pick, which would make him a second round choice.\nDeardorff, though, isn't getting into guessing games about where, or even if, he is going to be taken.\n\"I have no idea,\" he said, about where he would be drafted. \"People have said a lot of things, but I don't want to say anything in case it doesn't happen.\"\nSouth Lake baseball coach Mike Crawford, though, thinks Deardorff will reach his long-time goal.\n\"His goal in life is to play pro ball,\" Crawford said. \"The team that gets him will be extremely fortunate. They will be getting a kid with a great work ethic and a love of the game.\n\"He is not going to give 110 percent, he is going to give 120 percent. He is a kid who not only can beat you with his bat, but with his speed and with his glove.\"\nDeardorff, who played third base for South Lake High School this year and was an outfielder before that, has been the object of desire by pro scouts this spring. Early this year, more than 20 scouts were showing up at games and practices to watch Deardorff's skill at the plate, his smooth fielding ability and his strong arm.\nDeardorff, who played for the U.S. Junior Olympic team last summer, finished this season with a .463 batting average, 8 home runs, 31 RBIs, 31 runs scored and 22 stolen bases.\nHe starred this weekend at the Florida Athletic Coaches Association's All-Star Games, and also has attended three or four workouts recently, including ones with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays and New York Yankees.\nThe Montreal Expos, who have eight of the first 52 picks in the draft, also have shown a lot of interest as have the Milwaukee Brewers, Pittsburgh Pirates, Cleveland Indians, Boston Red Sox, Cincinnati Reds, Houston Astros, Chicago White Sox and Arizona Diamondbacks.\n\"I saw where he is being projected between the first and fifth rounds. That is great when you consider all the collegiate players like (FSU's) J.D. Drew are also in there. I think he is going to go reasonably high. I think he will definitely go before the fifth round,\" said Crawford.\nDeardorff, who is an early baseball signee with the University of Miami, is just thankful that the day finally has arrived.\n\"It's a little bit of a relief,\" he said. \"I can get all of this out of the way and go out and play for a job.\"",

        "Two UAE orders for military helicopters and guided bombs capped a remarkable year for procurement in which the Emirates became the largest foreign purchaser of US defence equipment, a Pentagon agency said.\nThe UAE, which has peacekeepers in Afghanistan, awarded Sikorksy Aircraft a US$171 million (Dh628m) contract for 14 UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters, which are used for tactical transport.\nSeparately, the US defence security co-operation agency, a unit of the Pentagon, said last week it had notified Congress of a potential sale of enhanced guided bomb units, parts, training and support to the UAE for about $290m.\nThe same agency said in November that in the last fiscal year the UAE became the largest foreign purchaser of US defence equipment with sales of $7.9bn, ahead of Afghanistan ($5.4bn), Saudi Arabia ($3.3bn) and Taiwan ($3.2bn).\nThe spending included orders for munitions for the UAE\u2019s F-16 fighter jets as well as a new Patriot defensive missile system and a fleet of corvettes for the navy.\nThe UAE purchases have been fuelled by a quadrupling of oil prices in the past decade and by continuing regional tensions, including those involving Iran, the US and Israel over the Islamic republic\u2019s nuclear programme.\nThe helicopter deal will require Sikorsky to configure the aircraft to UAE specifications and should be completed by the end of 2012.\nThe main contractors for the second deal announced last week are Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, the Pentagon agency said.\nA number of deals could be announced this year as the UAE fills gaps in its defence system.\n\u201cThe Government is still very active and there are a few things it needs to close here,\u201d Mr Kahwaji said. Those include contracts for C-17 and C-130 military transport aeroplanes, advanced trainer jets and the French Rafale fighter jet.\nThe advanced trainer jet contract with Alenia Aermacchi of Italy was expected to be announced at the Dubai Airshow in November but was postponed because of unresolved issues surrounding the production of parts in the UAE, Mr Kahwaji said. \u201cThere are a lot of technical issues that go into these contracts and they can get very complicated,\u201d he said.",
        "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Democratic lawmakers must soon decide whether President Barack Obama is leading them toward statesmanlike courage or political folly.\nObama used his first State of the Union speech Wednesday to push nervous Democrats to forge ahead on health care, despite voters' worries and opposition from newly strengthened Republicans. Sharpening his focus on the economy, he offered a hodgepodge of tax breaks and other incentives to create new jobs.\nFor Republicans, Obama blended a mix of overtures and digs. But he mainly addressed fellow Democrats, who still can enact his agenda if they overcome fears fueled by events such as last week's stunning GOP victory in the Massachusetts Senate race.\nThat setback may have cost Democrats their filibuster-proof Senate majority, Obama said, but \"we still have the largest majority in decades, and the people expect us to solve some problems, not run for the hills.\"\nHe accepted partial blame for the deep troubles facing his health care push, but he implored lawmakers to finish the task rather than yield to public opposition.\n\"The longer it was debated, the more skeptical people became,\" Obama told the joint session of Congress and a nationwide TV audience. But health care problems will continue for millions, he said, and \"I will not walk away from these Americans, and neither should the people in this chamber.\"\nHouse and Senate Democratic leaders are scrambling to see if they can salvage the ambitious health care package, which Republicans almost universally oppose. Obama's pep talk was a call to arms, but he offered no new strategies for overcoming the steep parliamentary and political hurdles they face.\nThe president devoted most of his 65-minute speech to job-creation proposals, such as eliminating capital gains taxes on small business investment and extending tax breaks for businesses to invest in new plants and equipment. But those proposals also face uncertainty in Congress, where Senate Democrats say they may need a selective, piecemeal approach to win enough votes.\nObama said Republicans share a responsibility for governing, and he proposed meeting with their House and Senate leaders monthly. But his olive branch seemed brittle at times.\nWithout naming George W. Bush, he pointedly noted that the previous administration left him a big deficit and a deeply troubled economy. For good measure, Obama said the United States killed more al-Qaida terrorists in 2009 than in 2008.\nObama rebuked the Supreme Court for a recent decision that \"reversed a century of law to open the floodgates for special interests\" and foreign corporations to make unlimited campaign contributions. At that, conservative Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito made a dismissive face, shook his head in disagreement and seemed to mouth the words \"not true\" as the president spoke.\nRepublicans in the House chamber generally greeted such remarks with stony gazes and smirks. The statements they issued as soon as Obama finished \u2014 or even before he finished, in some cases \u2014 were equally icy.\n\"We had hoped to hear a new commitment to keep his promises to govern from the center, change the tone in Washington, and work with both parties in a bipartisan way to help small businesses create jobs and get our economy moving again,\" said House Republican Leader John Boehner of Ohio. \"Unfortunately, the president and the Democrats in charge of Congress still aren't listening to the American people.\"\nVice President Joe Biden, appearing in an interview Thursday morning on NBC's \"Today\" show, described Obama as upset with the way his program has been handled in Congress.\n\"One of the things that's most frustrating to him,\" Biden said, \"is the obstructionist ways of the United States Senate, on the part of the Republicans, requiring 60 votes, a supermajority, for virtually every single, solitary initiative we've had. Now that we have 59 votes, it's time for everybody to start taking responsibility.\"\nObama has the luxury of waiting until 2012 to seek re-election, while all 435 House seats and a third of the Senate seats are up for grabs this November. Some Democrats most nervous about the election are urging the administration to slow down, especially on the health care issue that has dominated Congress's attention for months.\nObama gave them no comfort. \"Change has not come fast enough\" for millions of Americans, he said. \"We must answer history's call.\"\nAt the same time, however, the president tried to give Democrats some political cover on other sensitive issues, such as the bank bailouts that angered many voters.\n\"We all hated the bank bailout,\" he said. \"I hated it. You hated it. It was about as popular as a root canal.\"\nThe president also tried to chip away at GOP talking points.\n\"Let me repeat, we cut taxes,\" he said, citing his administration's tax cuts \"for 95 percent of working families.\"\nRepublicans are quick to note that the deficit has soared during Obama's year in office, and proposals such as the health care overhaul would impose new taxes on high-end medical insurance policies, among other things.\nIn their post-speech commentaries, several Democrats ignored nearly all of Obama's remarks except those aimed at creating jobs, the biggest issue on voters' minds.\n\"His focus was right where it belongs: on jobs and the economy, and on reforming the financial sector,\" said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich. \"He acknowledged his own mistakes, and he avoided pointing partisan fingers.\"\nMichael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee, was less charitable.\nIf Obama is serious about improving the economy, Steele said, \"he will give Republicans a seat at the table. If not, then we know that this is just more spin, arrogance and a refusal to listen to the American people.\"",

Tom Carper (D-Del.), the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act (DERA) of 2019 would reauthorize the program at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency through 2024 to assist firms with rebuilding or retrofitting diesel engines. The objective is for those updated engines to be able to comply with pollution standards.\nThe Environment and Public Works panel advanced the measure to the floor of the Senate by voice vote. Carper, the panel\u2019s ranking Democrat, had initially authored the bill more than a decade ago with former Ohio Sen. George Voinovich (R).\n\u201cWith today\u2019s vote, we\u2019re one step closer to making sure this bipartisan tradition, imagined and incepted by my dear friend Sen. Voinovich, will continue to boost economic growth and encourage environmental progress,\u201d Carper added. Voinovich died in 2016.\nCo-sponsors of the bill include committee Chairman John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), as well as Republican Sens.

        "'When Travis hollered, I was definitely flattered,' Kanye West's DJ says of getting the drummer's call.\nIt's been nearly a year since Travis Barker performed with a DJ, but now, he's getting ready to hit the road again, this time with Kanye West's main man behind the decks.\nBarker will be teaming up with turntablist A-Trak \u2014 West's touring DJ \u2014 for a run of shows, scheduled to kick off March 9-10 at Hollywood's Roxy Theatre. The gigs will mark the first time he's performed live with a DJ since the death of his partner DJ AM in August. But, as Barker told MTV News earlier this month, he had always considered working with Trak on a project of some sort. And after the two jammed a bit last year, both men knew they had to take their show to the stage.\n\"I had met A-Trak last year at Coachella, but I had seen a set of his at Avalon in Los Angeles maybe four years ago, with AM,\" Barker told MTV News. \"He was a guy who I always wanted to work with in some way. So I gave him a call.\"\n\"When Travis hollered, I was definitely flattered. We started by jamming once, back in the fall, just came over to the studio, and we did, like, one hour of jamming, which we thought was maybe a half an hour,\" A-Trak added. \"I just started playing records and scratching, and he was playing on top, and it went really, really naturally. It was very fluid. And we stopped and looked at the watch, and it was like, 'Oh, we've been playing for an hour and didn't even realize it.' And I think that solidified for both of us in our minds that we could do this pretty easily.\"\nThe duo will perform versions of each other's remixes (they've reworked tracks for everyone from Eminem and Soulja Boy Tell'em to MSTRKRFT and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs), plus new material they've been working on in Barker's Los Angeles studio. Or, at least, that's the plan right now.\n\"It's going to be a mix of everything,\" A-Trak said. \"We're still kind of rehearsing it, but I think it's going to be some songs people recognize, some of the remixes Travis has done, some of my remixes. Just kind of mix it up.\"\nBarker said the duo plan to start small, with the pair of shows at Hollywood's Roxy Theatre, before taking the show wide. Additional shows will follow later in March in Las Vegas, Austin's South by Southwest and Miami.\n\"Our first shows are at the Roxy, and then South by Southwest will probably be a little bit bigger,\" Barker said. \"The Winter Music Conference in Miami will probably be a little bit bigger. But the first ones will be really intimate.\"\n\"We might do a run of side shows in health clubs and saunas,\" A-Trak laughed. \"Just set up in the steam bath and play. It was an idea we had yesterday.\"\nTickets go on sale Thursday. The show will kick off with Rob Roy and Kid Sister before Barker and A-Trak take the stage.",

        "Lynn Blake, left, teaches two hospital employees CPR at the VVMC Safety Fair. Blake\u00e2\u0080\u0099s passion for educating Eagle County residents came from her own Sudden Cardiac Arrest, which a bystander provided CPR and saved her life. She was just 27 at the time.\nOn Valentine\u2019s Day 2007, Lynn Blake was embarking on a new job in Vail Village when she had a rude awakening. The 27-year-old suffered sudden cardiac arrest. Fortunately for her, someone trained in CPR stepped forward and kept her heart beating until emergency personnel arrived with a defibrillator. If someone dropped in front of you unconscious, with no notable pulse, would you know what to do? Some 325,000 people die every year of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) in the United States. And, contrary to popular belief, it strikes people of all ages. \u201cI did not know a thing about cardiac arrest. I didn\u2019t know what it was,\u201d Blake said. Now she knows firsthand about sudden cardiac arrest. The more she found out, the more she wondered why more people weren\u2019t educated about SCA, the leading causes of death in the U.S. Just a few months after Blake\u2019s sudden cardiac arrest, area pro biker Mike Janelle, in the prime of his life, died of SCA.\u201dIt\u2019s a lot more common than people realize,\u201d Blake said. Yet, she found, \u201cno one\u2019s really educating people about cardiac arrest.\u201d That\u2019s why she founded the Starting Hearts Foundation, partnering with the Vail Valley Medical Center and area emergency services. Starting Hearts is a non-profit dedicated to saving the lives of SCA victims, through communitywide CPR and AED (Automated External Defibrillation) education and access. \u201cVail Valley Medical Center embraces Lynn\u2019s mission,\u201d said Doris Kirchner, CEO and president of Vail Valley Medical Center. \u201cVVMC is in the business of saving lives, and Starting Hearts can have a direct impact on that mission by engaging the community to help recognize and react to SCA appropriately.\u201d Community key to saving lives Nearly 60 percent of cardiac arrests are witnessed. Most people know to call 911. But if that\u2019s all you know about saving someone from SCA, the victim\u2019s chance of surviving is slim. It is estimated 95 percent of cardiac arrest victims die before reaching a hospital if they do not receive shock treatment, such as from a defibrillator. That is why the response of bystanders is so critical to saving lives. Yet, Blake found the vast majority of people aren\u2019t trained in CPR or using an AED. CPR classes tend to be taken only by those in jobs that demand the skill. Even if a layperson struggles to find a nearby course, it is difficult, Blake explains. Finding an AED is no easy task either. To address these issues, Starting Hearts acquired a decommissioned bus, and created the HeartRod, a mobile CPR/AED training unit, sponsored by Vail Valley Medical Center. Now, Blake, a certified instructor, travels to community events, Eagle County Schools and businesses teaching CPR and AED classes. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t going to come to me; I need to be able to go to them,\u201d Blake said.Blake also created the event \u201cAll You Need is Heart,\u201d which will take place on Feb. 14 at The Sebastian in Vail. The event focuses on personal heart health, including more than $1,200 worth of heart screens such as EKG\u2019s, ultrasounds and cholesterols test. There are also feature presentations on endurance sports and the affects of high altitude, overcoming life\u2019s challenges and savings lives in Eagle County. The event is $150 per person and is a fundraiser for Starting Hearts Foundation. Save more livesStarting Hearts will launch the ambitious \u201cSave More Lives\u201d campaign. \u201cOur goal is to annually educate 25,000 people in Eagle County,\u201d in CPR and AED, Blake said. As part of the campaign, Blake decided to apply the type of lessons every child has grasped. \u201cIf you ask anyone what to do if they catch on fire, they\u2019d respond, \u2018stop, drop and roll.\u2019 Starting Hearts came up with a similar unforgettable message for SCA: \u2018Call, push and shock.'\u201d Dr. Lawrence Gaul is the Starting Hearts medical director. He was the cardiologist who treated Blake when she came into the Vail Valley Medical Center during her cardiac arrest episode. \u201cIt\u2019s simple,\u201d Gaul said, explaining Call, push and shock. \u201cCall 911. Do rapid compressions in the middle of the chest and shock the person. When someone has a cardiac arrest the most important thing needed is shock.\u201d That\u2019s why, over the next year, the Save More Lives campaign will focus during on placing portable AEDs in strategic public places around Eagle County so anyone can find the nearest AED in emergencies.When Dr. Gaul traveled to Monaco for a medical conference, he was surprised to see this tiny country filled with street signs everywhere pointing to the nearest AED. By 2015, when the World Cup arrives in the Vail Valley, Dr. Gaul and Starting Hearts hope to have AEDs similarly available.To Blake, it is most rewarding when someone comes and tells her one of the classes she taught made a difference. There was the lady who took her class and was able to remove an object stuck in the throat of her choking grandchild through CPR. And the little girl who took one of her courses through the Youth Foundation and went home and practiced CPR with her family. \u201cI encourage everyone in this community to get involved and participate in the Save More Lives campaign,\u201d Blake said. \u201cIf everyone gets involved, we really can do it.\u201dTo participate in Save More Lives, find out about CPR and AED classes or to donate, contact Starting Hearts by emailing lynn@startinghearts.org or calling 970-331-3983.",

        "After competing many times, local artist Ann Iungerich and her husband, David, decided to share some lessons learned Saturday in an ice-sculpting workshop.\nThe concept was more sculptors might make for a better competition.\n\"We've done a lot of research and tried to figure out what's what. That was why we decided to have a workshop - what few little secrets we know, we're willing to share that with others,\" Ann explained.\nAnn and David Iungerich taught the half dozen participants how to chop away at the ice, just using wood chisels.\n\"Over the years, we've learned that just wood chisels work the best for us,\" Ann said. \"We don't bring any power tools. We just have different various sharp chisels and that's what we use.\"\nThere's typically six to eight teams each year, and the Iungerichs are hoping this workshop will expand involvement and break down the barrier for people who may be interested in competing themselves.\nAlthough she is an artist in many other mediums herself, Ann says she had never sculpted ice before her first year. After a friend suggested she try it, Ann said, \"Sure!\"\n\"I'm always up for a new adventure,\" Ann said.\nBut even as an artist herself, she said it was a little scary to start.\n\"It was a little bit intimidating, because we didn't know exactly how to do what we were doing, and yet it was exhilarating to watch, to take the blocks from nothing,\" she said.\nAnn says she competed that first year with her husband and her son.

It's a blast.\"\nAlex Vance, a fan of Iungerich's, decided to come to the workshop because she loves her work.\n\"I'm an Ann Iungerich fan, so I follow her,\" Vance said. \"Then she said: 'Here! Try it!' And now my hands are cold and I don't know what i'm doing.

What's the worst that could happen? You could fail! Big deal, so what. It's just for fun. Just be part of a team and enjoy it.\"\nFor those who could not attend, a Facebook live of the event was filmed and Iungerich said they may upload it to YouTube.

A woman in the US is as likely to suffer a maternal death as a woman in sanctions-hit Iran, and four times as likely as a woman in Germany.\n\"It is a preventable health issue,\" said Amnesty International's Rachel Ward. \"It isn't something that we're waiting for a cure for. We\u2019re waiting for political will.\"\nWhat's worse is that US maternal mortality rates may actually be on the rise. Eugene Declercq, of Boston University's School of Public Health, produced a short film named Birth by the numbers, discussing maternal mortality in the US. In a 2013 follow-up report, he noted how mortality rates in other industrialised nations had declined - but in the US, it increased by 30 percent in the first decade of the new millennium.\nAnother 2013 report, this one by Truven Health Analytics, says the US spends more than any other country on costs associated with maternal healthcare. So why are American mothers still dying of pregnancy related deaths?\nThe answer is complex and belies simple solutions.\n\"There is sadly no magic bullet that explains what is behind the high levels of maternal mortality in the United States,\" Amnesty's Rachel Ward said. \"It's a combination of factors that speak to the systemic problems of failing to provide affordable, accessible, quality health services to all women in the United States.\"\nOne of these factors is likely the demographics of new mothers in the US.\n\"Our women are older. Our main maternal age has risen,\" said Dr Sarah Kilpatrick of the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. \"We have a lot more women in their late 30s and 40s, when you have a higher chance of having other health issues such as cardiac disease.\" Obesity is also on the rise in the country, which also increases the chances of birthing complications.\nMany believe that the US healthcare system is in crisis. The Henry J Kaiser Family Foundation reported that 47 million non-elderly US residents had no health insurance in 2012.\nUninsured pregnant women are eligible for Medicaid. But, according to the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, they receive fewer prenatal care services, are more likely to enter pregnancy with health problems, and are more likely to have adverse maternal health outcomes.\nIt is a preventable health issue. It isn't something that we're waiting for a cure for. We\u2019re waiting for political will.\nPoor women and women of colour are by far the hardest hit by this crisis. In 2012, 23 percent of African-American women and 36 percent of Hispanic women had no health insurance.\nA 2013 report by the New York Women's Foundation found that black women in New York City had a maternal mortality rate of 79 deaths per 100,000 live births - compared with 10 per 100,000 live births for white women. That means black women in New York have worse maternal mortality rates than women in either Syria or Iraq.\nThose numbers reflect a trend also cited in an Amnesty International 2011 follow up to its report, Deadly Delivery, which found that women in low-income areas were twice as likely to die a maternal death than women in high-income areas, and black women were four times as likely as white women to die while giving birth to a child.\nOpen Arms Perinatal Services in Seattle is one organisation trying to fill the gaps women are slipping through. Open Arms provides doula care, non-medical social and emotional support to low-income mothers.\n\"When Martin Luther King Jr was born, his mother did not have access to the local hospital because she was black, so we have this history of separating care,\" Open Arms Executive Director Sheila Capestany told Al Jazeera. \"So you build things into your systems that are really hard to undo, and you have to undo them intentionally, you can't just expect they're going to go away.\"\nShe believes that these community-based solutions are a crucial part of undoing the historical injustices that continue to resonate today.\nFocusing only on access to care obscures a more fundamental problem - whether that care is of a decent quality, even for those who can afford it.\nWhite women, the demographic most likely to have positive birth outcomes, and more likely to have health insurance, still have worse indicators than their counterparts in 24 other industrialised countries.\nIn the United States, if you define all births as 'potentially dangerous', then you would make the argument that you need a specialist for every birth. That perspective has persisted, and, given that, we've got a problem.\nIn almost every other industrialised nation, comprehensive maternal healthcare is inexpensive or even free. In Britain, midwives usually visit mothers at home two weeks after birth. In the Netherlands, more than 16 percent of births occur at home under the care of a midwife and are covered by insurance. In France, coverage includes a week's stay in the hospital, during which women also receive training in caring for her newborn.\nMost US insurance companies cover only what is considered medically necessary - and that usually means discharging women a day or two after birth with a single post-natal check-up six weeks after delivery. Ward, the managing director of Amnesty International's US programme told Al Jazeera this six weeks is a critical time period.\n\"Tameka McFarquhar, she was 22, she bled to death in her apartment in New York after giving birth,\" Ward said of one of the women featured in her research. \"She was alone, a home visit could have saved her life.\"\nAny area of neglect represents risks to maternal health, but with the right research and investment applied, such problems present opportunities to those working to reverse the numbers.\n\"Maternal death is not solved yet, but I think we\u2019re making huge strides to reduce it,\" said Kilpatrick, the chair of the department of obstetrics and gynaecology at Cedars-Sinai.\nUS President Barack Obama's signature healthcare programme, the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans have tried to change or repeal a number of times, aims to increase the number of Americans with health insurance. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists believes this could decrease the chances that women may become pregnant while already having potentially life threatening health problems.\nOne low-cost solution is the increased use of midwives. The majority of births around the world are attended to by midwives. In Britain, that includes 57 percent of births.\nStateside, fewer than eight percent of births are assisted by midwives. Most births are attended to by doctors, part of what makes maternal healthcare in the US so expensive.\n\"In the United States, if you define all births as 'potentially dangerous', then you would make the argument that you need a specialist for every birth. That perspective has persisted, and, given that, we've got a problem,\u201d said Boston University's Declercq.\nThe problem is financial but it also may be medical. The rate of caesarean sections in the US is more than 30 percent - more than double the World Health Organisation's recommendation.\nExposing mothers to interventions such as caesarean sections when they are not necessary also exposes them to potential risks, say experts.\nThe American Congress of Obstetricians and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine recently released guidelines recommending that unnecessary caesarean sections should be reduced.\n\"In my mind, there is no doubt that our C-section rate is too high in the United States,\" said Kilpatrick of Cedars-Sinai. \"The good news is that it has plateaued. It's been the same for two to three years now.\"\nAmid the variety of medical and governmental changes that are being made, Capestany from Open Arms believes that there is also a basic social change that needs to be made in the way Americans understand childbirth.\n\"It's not intuitive in the United States that, in fact, childbirth is more than just a medical event. It is a physical event that requires medical attention, social attention, and emotional attention,\" Capestany told Al Jazeera.\n\"Until we acknowledge that, we're not going to be able to get the best care.\"",
        "MOVE Systems: redesigning NYC's 1970s-era food trucks for an eco-friendly future.\nMaking the less-noxious food cart into an art.\nThere are 5,000 licensed food carts in New York, and they\u2019re as much of an urban icon as the MTA\u2019s subway signage or the Chrysler building. Too bad they\u2019re killing the planet.\nIt\u2019s not the food\u2014the grub is OK, if not exactly slimming; it\u2019s the gas generators powering the carts. Most food carts run off a diesel generator that\u2019s designed to run only a few hours. Vendors run them for stretches of up to 14 hours, leading to a high output of greenhouse-gas emissions such as carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide, and particulate matter. You can see the smoke with the naked eye, but the hard facts are even more frightening: The research and consulting firm Energy Vision found that each cart produces the same amount of nitrous oxide as 186 cars on the road.\nA new pilot program between the city and a Queens-based company called MOVE Systems aims to cut down on that pollution by at least 60 percent. For the past year, MOVE has been fine-tuning a new kind of food cart\u2014called the MRV100\u2014that\u2019s powered by a mix of battery-generated electricity and solar energy, instead of dirty gas. The plan calls for getting a fleet of 500 new carts up and running by the summer of 2016, with the first 100 slated to roll out this summer.\nFor a 40-or-so-year-old design, the typical food cart is actually pretty sturdy and resilient. \u201cThe quality is surprisingly good,\u201d says Michael Dubrovsky, a co-founder of Simply Grid, which merged with Mobile Vending Natural Gas a year ago to form MOVE Systems. It\u2019s good enough that MOVE initially planned to retrofit existing food carts with products akin to electric vehicle chargers, rather than manufacturing an entirely new line of carts. Then they took a closer look under the hood to discover that none of these carts has the same design. \u201cEach one is made artisanally in Queens and Brooklyn, at what we call chop shops,\u201d Dubrovsky says. \u201cEach one has different compartments, the plumbing is not up to code, so by the time you rip all that out, all of a sudden you\u2019ve put liability on yourself.\u201d So MOVE had to scrap the magpie carts and start from scratch.\nOne hundred of the first carts will be funded by MOVE and reserved for disabled veterans, and the remaining 400 will go to vendors who sign up\u2014at no cost to them, because the pilot program will be sponsored. (MOVE says they are still reviewing sponsors and advertisers and have yet to make a selection.) Vendors will still have to shoulder the costs of the compressed natural gas fuel (but not Internet connectivity), but Energy Vision\u2019s report also suggests that running a food cart on grid power could save $5,200 a year in energy charges.",
        "President Trump\u2019s decision Monday to revive plans to freeze federal employee pay in 2020 and to institute a series of cuts to federal employee retirement programs was met with great consternation from stakeholder groups, although the ideas stand little chance of becoming law.\nIncreasing employee contributions toward federal defined benefit annuity programs by 1 percent per year until those payments reach 50 percent of the total cost.\nEliminating cost of living adjustments for FERS retirees, and reducing CSRS cost of living adjustments by 0.5 percent.\nEliminating the FERS supplement for employees forced to retire before Social Security kicks in at age 62.\nChanging annuity calculations for federal workers' retirement to be based on the average of their highest five years of salary, rather than the current highest three years.\nReducing the interest rate of the Thrift Savings Plan\u2019s government securities (G) fund, basing it on the yield of either the three-month or four-week U.S. Treasury bill, rather than a weighted average of all Treasury investments.\nThe administration will not reveal the precise details of these proposals until next week. But each idea has been floated in some form in both 2017 and 2018, and Congress has not implemented any. The likelihood of any of these proposals being included in a final appropriations bill seems even slimmer now, with Democrats now in control of the House.\nManagement groups also criticized the White House\u2019s approach to federal employee compensation. Although the Senior Executives Association was less overtly critical in its reaction, SEA President Bill Valdez said that the more positive elements of the fiscal roadmap would be undermined in practice by the decision to disinvest in the workforce.\n\u201cEven as the budget proposal suggests that our national and homeland security requires additional staffing in the military and along our borders, the budget reiterates penny-wise and pound-foolish proposals to enact federal pay freezes and benefit and retirement cuts, thus implicitly assuring applicants interested in those posts that working for the federal government would mean enduring instability and ceaseless attacks surrounding even their most basic compensation,\u201d Valdez said.",

        "The amount is part of the N8.8tn tax revenue needed by the government to finance the 2019 budget.\nDetails of how the revenue would be generated are contained in the Medium Term Expenditure Framework Tax Revenue Projections for 2019-2021.\nThe document, which was submitted to the National Assembly by the Executive Chairman of FIRS, Mr Tunde Fowler, was obtained on Friday by our correspondent.\nIn the document, the FIRS said the N8.8tn would be realised through two major tax revenue components. They are oil tax revenue, where N4.3tn would be collected and non-oil tax revenue where the service had proposed to generate N4.5tn for the government.\nFurther breakdown of the oil tax revenue showed that the entire N4.3tn is expected to come from petroleum profit tax.\nFor the non oil tax revenue, an analysis of the document shows that N1.7tn is expected to be earned from company income tax, while gas income, capital gains tax and stamp duty are expected to earn N685.63bn, N6.27bn and N17.64bn, respectively for the government.\nAlso, Value Added Tax is expected to contribute N1.7tn; education tax, N275.39bn; consolidated account, N99.78bn and Nigeria Information Technology Development Fund, N20.01bn.\nThe FIRS in the document stated that the tax revenue target for 2019 was based on the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan of the Federal Government.\nIt said that to boost tax revenue, a lot of initiatives would be implemented with support from the government.\nSome of them are the expansion of Tax Identification database to cover federal, states and local government to establish a reliable VAT tax base across the country.\nWhile engaging relevant stakeholders, the service said it would develop and propose tax laws targeted at emerging sectors of the economy such as digital economies.\nIt said a review of existing tax laws to close the legal loopholes for taxes by adopting a sectoral, rules-based approach would be implemented.\nThe FIRS also stated that it would develop a strategy for revenue campaigns targeted at the informal sector of the economy, noting that a unified nationwide tax payer database would be developed.\nIt said a strong incentive programme aimed at encouraging tax payment by Nigerians would be designed.\nThe incentive, it noted, could involve tying government projects to tax revenue collected.",
        "WHEN predicting which planets beyond Earth could support life, astronomers usually follow the water. Exoplanets with rocky surfaces are declared habitable if they orbit far enough from their star to potentially host oceans.\nBut as our planetary collection grows, and telescopes for studying them improve, some astrobiologists say it is time to narrow the hunt. Christopher McKay at NASA\u2019s Ames Research Center in California has come up with an expanded \u201cchecklist\u201d for habitability, which also considers factors like a planet\u2019s light levels, radiation exposure and atmospheric composition (PNAS, DOI&colon; 10.1073/pnas.1304212111).\nSome items can be inferred just from knowing a planet\u2019s probable composition and distance from its host star. Others will require photographing the planets and examining their atmospheres. Spacecraft with those capabilities are now being developed.\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean we are positioned to do it yet, but the discussion has gotten very detailed and very specific,\u201d says Adam Burrows at Princeton University.\nThe list may one day pinpoint worlds that can be home to life even if conditions there would kill humans outright. For instance, McKay points to Chlamydomonas nivalis, or watermelon snow, a red-coloured alga that only grows in freezing water. And researchers have grown microbes in the lab at temperatures as high as 122 \u00b0C.\nEven planets with barely any water could host life, says McKay. Cyanobacteria, for example, live on rocks in the Atacama desert in Chile, which gets only a few days of rain and fog each year.\nAny life on another world would need sufficient light or geothermal energy to drive its vital processes. But this may not be a lot \u2013 deep-sea plants called red macroalgae can grow while receiving just 1 per cent of the sunlight hitting the ocean\u2019s surface.\nAnd while high levels of ultraviolet radiation may be a worry for complex life, microbes are much hardier. The most extreme example is Deinococcus radiodurans, which can survive in the sort of conditions you might find inside a nuclear reactor.\nHowever, we know of one place that could rewrite McKay\u2019s list. Saturn\u2019s moon Titan has liquids on its surface and an atmosphere. Its seas are filled with methane and ethane, and its atmosphere is a choking haze of nitrogen and methane. That doesn\u2019t seem so hospitable, but Titan has shown evidence of complex molecules that may be building blocks for life.\nWhen this article was first published, it described Chlamydomonas nivalis as a red alga.

        "Mattel's Future: Happily Ever After?\nMattel has a plan for the rest of the year, but it seems to be playing a shorter game.\nAccording to its most recent earnings release, Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT) seems to have become a victim of its own success. The company reported a 12% drop in revenue from its Barbie brand, while other girls' toys ate up market share. The American Girl and Monster High lines did particularly well, but the cost was high. As the newer lines continue to succeed, the questions around Barbie's future grow.\nMonster High is leading the way at Mattel, and analysts now believe that the business may be worth up to $500 million annually. That success has helped steer Mattel toward new opportunities, including a variation on Monster High -- which is a line of monsters in high school -- called Ever After High. The new line is going to hit stores in the second half of the year, and focuses on classic fairytale characters while they're in high school.\nWhen I say \"classic fairytale characters,\" I, of course, mean slightly rebranded Disney (NYSE:DIS) princesses. The list includes Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, and Cinderella-style characters, along with some princes, and Alice-in-Wonderland themed dolls.\nThe move makes an incredible amount of sense for Mattel, as Disney has had runaway success with its rebranding of the princesses as a separate line. According to analyst studies, the Princess line is generating $3 billion in annual global sales. That's six times what Monster High is pulling in, and highlights the value available in the marketplace. Since Mattel is only spending $10 million to $20 million to develop the spin-off lines , the payback is almost immediate.\nThe stock suffered a 7% drop yesterday in light of the shortfall from Mattel. Overall, the company managed a 1% increase in global sales, but it had a 25% drop in earnings per share . The long game for Mattel looks increasingly like an ever evolving line of girls' toys. While the company has had success with boys' lines, its real core lies in girls.\nOn the competitive side, Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) seems to have boys' toys locked down. The company is generating more than twice as much from its boys' toys as it does from girls' toys. That success is resting on the strength of Marvel-branded toys, G.I Joe, and NERF. Mattel is a much larger company, and Hasbro has to be content to simply succeed where it can.\nFor Mattel, the most interesting thing to come over the next year may be the conflict that arises between Mattel and Disney, if its Ever After brand takes off. Right now, Mattel produces a number of toys with the Disney branding, and it relies on a good relationship with the media company. Disney may start to see some encroachment on its territory, which could lead to a confrontation. But first, Ever After has to succeed.",

        "Most gardeners think of diascias as low-growing bedding plants suited to a summer container or the front of a sunny border.\nHowever Diascia personata breaks the mould and produces stiff stems that grow 3ft tall. The substantial bright green foliage supports dusky pink flowers and these appear in profusion from early May to November.\nHandsome, upright and show-stopping, it first came to my attention when Fergus Garrett of Great Dixter in East Sussex brought it to a Perennial Plant Day at RHS Wisley in June last year.\nHaving never seen it before I then spotted it two days later on a Hopleys' stand (see details below) and snapped it up.\nAlthough the form I acquired was labelled 'Hopleys', it is the same plant grown at Great Dixter.\nDiascias are found on the eastern side of southern Africa. There are 70 species in all and most are annual, but there are a few perennials.\nThey are members of the Scrophularia or figwort family, together with verbascum and buddleia, although the whole tribe has recently been reclassified.\nThe common name of diascia is \"twinspur\" and this refers to two spurs found at the back of the flower. The closely related genera Alonsoa and Nemesia look similar, but have more spurs - often these are longer.\nAlthough diascias flower for months in Britain they have a much shorter flowering season in their native land because they are pollinated by a different species of bee: Bees from the genus Rediviva (native to southern Africa) have extra long forelegs, and this allows them to reach the spurs of the flowers in order to collect a fatty oil produced by the glands.\nThe legs of the bee soak up the oil, rather like a sponge, and pollen is transferred to the body of the bee during this process. The flowers are then pollinated and fade. Our native bees have shorter legs and so fail to pollinate the flowers.\nIn the wild, different species of diascia growing together evolve and produce stamens of varying lengths, or in varying positions, so that any pollen deposited sticks to different parts of the bee's body.\nThis system prevents cross-pollination. But if the necessary species of bee is absent, the flowers are not pollinated, so flower longer.\nThe late plant breeder and hobbyist, Hector Harrison, of Appleby, in South Humberside, found out about diascia's pollination needs and began hand-pollinating three species about 1978. His first hybrids flowered in the mid-Eighties and he generously gave them to nurseries and enthusiasts.\nHarrison hybrids include 'Appleby Apricot', 'Iceberg', 'Salmon Supreme' and 'Lilac Belle'. White, lilac, various pinks and apricot diascias are all available.\nSome of these hybrids may be sterile even if they encounter the long-legged bees required for pollination: sterility often occurs when two closely related species hybridise.\nHarrison was, however, unaware of the first British-raised diascia. The late John Kelly, once curator at Abbotsbury Subtropical Gardens, applied the pollen from D. cordata to D. barberae. He grew nine seeds and named the best red-pink 'Ruby Field' after a lady who sometimes worked on the nursery.\nIt is now listed under D. barberae in the RHS Plant Finder so may not even be a hybrid. The diascia gene pool was further expanded when new species were collected in the Seventies for the Edinburgh Botanic Gardens.\nDiascia personata is a perennial from the Eastern Cape and hardier than the annual forms. It will survive most winters given a sunny position and well-drained soil.\nIts hardiness equates roughly to the dahlia in my opinion and \"insurance\" cuttings should be taken in early summer, in case of a hard winter.\nSometimes another plant, the similarly upright D. rigescens, is mistaken for D. personata and the flowers are a similar colour.\nThey are, however, significantly different: D. rigescens is shorter, between 1-2ft and the foliage a duller blue-green. It has less stature. I have successfully over wintered both of these, but last winter saw them off.\nDiascias are sun-loving plants, but enjoy fertile rather than dry, poor soil. The cushion-forming types can get straggly so cut them back in late April and late August to keep them compact.\nHardiness can be a problem, but many will survive winter in well-drained soil.\nCuttings can be taken between May and September. However, if you want to keep cuttings through the winter take them in the first half of summer so that a good root system is developed.\nLook for new growth that has started to harden slightly, preferably without flower buds. Cut off just below the node (the bumpy part where leaves are attached) so that your cutting measures roughly 4in long. Trim the cutting just below the bumpy node and strip any lower leaves.\nPlunge into a suitable rooting matter. This could be a mixture of compost and horticultural sand. I prefill small seed trays with damp horticultural sand and plunge cuttings in as I take them. No rooting compost or special equipment is needed.\nYou can containerise Diascia personata, but it has to be a substantial pot to balance the height of the plant. The ruby-pink flowers are excellent with dark blue agapanthus, purple dahlias or fluffy pennisetums.\nAt Great Dixter they use D. personata with the green and cream vertically striped grass, Miscanthus sinensis var. condensatus 'Cosmopolitan' to great effect. Graham Gough, of Marchants Plants, also uses it in his grass-led garden and he describes it as \"remarkable and lofty\".",

It's near the sherry decanter, which is from director Neil Bartlett (they worked together on the 1995 adaptation of the play Splendid's).\nThere are a lot of things Julian's bought with his mother. He wonders if the antique bucket in the corner, which he picked up when they were \"talked into\" doing a celebrity version of Bargain Hunt, is too rustic. \"It certainly wasn't my idea to do the show,\" he remembers, \"but she fancied it.

        "The Airline Vikings were playing for the state football championship in 1972 against Neville on a bad night for football in Monroe.\nBut after the team had gathered itself, head coach Jack Gray called his seniors together.\nGray, who coached the 1967 Airline team to the state title, passed away Thursday and services are set for Saturday at 3 p.m. in Marshall, Texas, where he lived. Visitation is Friday from 5 to 7 p.m.\nGray\u2019s niece, Becky Gray, is the assistant principal at Parkway and his brother lives in Bossier City. He is survived by his wife, Mimi, and a son, Gary who lives in Farmerville.\nSlack said Gray was the kind of coach any teenager would love to have.\n\u201cHe was caring, loving and gentle, but he always expected the best out of you,\u201d Slack said.\nIn 1971, Slack said it was well known that Gray, a native of Shelbyville, Texas, went to Marshall to interview for the head coaching job there.\nWhen the Vikings played at Texarkana, Arkansas, as juniors, the team had a huge defensive end named Ronald Johnson, the brother of NFL All-Pro Gary \u201cBig Hands\u201d Johnson.\n\u201cRonald had a forearm that would knock you out and he injured a couple of the Texarkana players. They were the top team in Arkansas and we beat them,\u201d Slack said. \u201cThe next year when we play them, they\u2019re out to get Ronald and it started a huge fight at the end of the game, which was never finished. They were chasing Ronald all over the field, so he finally ran to our sideline and picked up one of the downs markers and started swinging it at them.\nGray was originally hired at Airline by John Ropp not long after Airline opened in 1964. He also coached at Ruston High and then later at Marshall, where he was also athletic director and an administrator.\nAfter retirement, Gray and his wife were active in delivering \u201cMeals on Wheels\u201d and working with the Humane Society.

        "In the summer of 1993, I had one of those experiences that stay with me for the rest of my life.\nI spent 10 weeks in Europe, beginning with a six-week law-school summer session at Charles University in Prague.\nPrague was, as much as any place, the cradle of culture in central Europe, and it was sometimes the capital of the Holy Roman Empire. Its ancient center was architecturally and many other ways romantic and gorgeous. Because it was subject only to rather minor bombing, Prague\u2019s charm and beauty were nearly unscathed by World War II.\nBut 45 years of socialist \u201ccompassion\u201d under a Soviet Union puppet regime had turned everything soot gray and ugly before eastern and central Europe was liberated in 1989.\nWhen I arrived, you could walk down the winding cobblestone streets of the Old Town near its famous castle amid five-story ancient residential buildings standing shoulder-to-shoulder against narrow sidewalks on both sides. Buildings that had once been vibrant with color, exquisite in their features and soaring to the sky were now soot-gray dingy, decaying and seemingly drooping in shame.\nThen, out of nowhere, came one that was a brilliant pastel lime-green, fully restored and bursting with light and life. Then soot-gray, soot-gray and suddenly another one, bright pink, restored to its original glory. Soot-gray, soot-gray, soot-gray. And another beauty reclaimed in rich mustard yellow.\nAnd then, across the street, amid more weeping soot-gray ghosts, a sight that explained everything: One of the old wrecks with its entire face covered with \u2026 scaffolding. The secret of a second Prague Spring was revealed as people liberated from the yoke of coercive collectivism and soaring in restored liberty were scrubbing away the toxic dirt of statist oppression, rebuilding the decorative art that was their heritage, and baptizing it all with lovely color.\nIt was especially moving because in 1968 I had been an ardent fan of the (first) Prague Spring, led by a Czechoslovakian freedom movement that was brutally crushed in the city\u2019s main square by Soviet tank squads.\nThis month we celebrate the 25th anniversary of the stunning 1989 collapse of the Soviet and Eastern Block, highlighted by the fall of the Berlin Wall and the liberation of Prague and eastern and central Europe.\nGrowing up in the 1950s with basement bomb shelters, air-raid sirens and duck-and-cover drills in response to threats from that truly Evil Empire created even in children an abiding sense of unease \u2014 an understanding that serious threats were afoot in the world. As the Cold War became normalcy, there was vague despair for three more decades at a world locked in continuing tension due to the menace we thought was permanent because its evil controlled the world\u2019s second most powerful nation and others. With all that exacerbated by the rise of Red China, it seemed like a nightmare that would never end.\nThen, of a sudden, there was light in the world as the Evil Empire simply crumbled, being unable to keep up with the West\u2019s prosperity brought by the renewed commitment to freedom of Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher and others. The unimaginable happened: The bad guys simply folded and communism collapsed due to its own \u201cinternal contradictions\u201d.\nToday, we face domestic challenges from progressivism, socialism\u2019s close cousin. We face serious international challenges from terrorism, much of it ideological or religion-based and some of it just insane. I don\u2019t minimize these challenges. However, whenever I feel daunted by them, I remember the second Prague Spring and the collapse of something even bigger and worse that we thought would never end, and I\u2019m hopeful.\nRon Knecht is an economist, law-school graduate, higher education regent and Nevada controller-elect.",

Lillard, 25, signed a five-year, $120 million extension last summer, so he wouldn&apos;t be hitting the free-agent market for some time.\nBut maybe Durant&apos;s move to the Bay Area has created a backlash among NBA stars, pushing them to compete against each other instead of join forces.

        "Ukraine has started siphoning off Russian gas bound for European customers. This follows the cutoff of gas supplies to Ukraine on January 1, after the two countries\u2019 gas companies failed to agree on a price for 2009.\nGazprom deputy CEO Aleksandr Medvedev is in Prague to inform the EU about the on-going gas conflict with Ukraine, blaming Ukraine for the reduction in supplies.\nGazprom's board has held an emergency meeting in Moscow where they were discussing Ukraine's siphoning of gas.\n\u201cUkraine has cynically announced it's siphoning off gas from the export pipe. Dispatchers in the Balkans say the region is already suffering from Ukarine's actions. Gazprom believes the Balkan states need to use the Energy Charter signed by Ukraine to protect themselves. This charter says no contract disputes should affect supplies provided by a transit country,\u201d stated Gazprom\u2019s Deputy CEO Aleksandr Medvedev.\nEarlier on Friday the company\u2019s spokesman Sergey Kuriyanov said that Ukraine is avoiding negotiations with Gazprom. He noted that Ukraine\u2019s Naftogaz has promised to pay $US 1.5 billion by January 11.\n\u201cBut there will still be an outstanding debt of $US 614 million. Therefore, we plan to increase the transit level of gas through Belarus,\u201d Kupriyanov said.\nUkraine, however, has denied it is siphoning off gas from transit pipes.\nAlso, according to Russia\u2019s Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr Grushko, Russia has asked the EU parliament to hold a special meeting to discuss the issue of Russian gas transits via Ukraine.\n\u201cGazprom representatives are ready to head to Brussels, and all European countries, to fully inform them about the dispute between Gazprom and Ukraine's Naftogaz,\u201d he said.\nEarlier Gazprom spokesman Sergey Kupriyanov said that independent auditors are being blocked from checking whether gas supplies to Europe are being hindered.\n\u201cWe don't have an effective gas delivery contract with Naftogaz now. Naftogaz is currently obstructing the operators of RosUkrEnergo and is not letting them extract the gas from underground facilities which they have,\u201d said Kupriyanov.\nThere is still no contract signed between the two countries and debts must be paid in full before another can be signed. The Russian energy company has also calculated over $US 600 million in penalties Ukraine owes.\nGazprom\u2019s overall supply reduction amounted to 90 million cubic metres a day, which is roughly Ukraine\u2019s consumption.\nBoth Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko and Prime Minister Yulia Timoshenko have appealed to Russia not to cut gas supplies to the country and to continue talks. They've also named the price their country is prepared to pay for the gas: $US 201 per 1,000 cubic metres.\nGazprom, though, wanted a higher price \u2013 $US 250 per 1,000 cubic metres \u2013 which is almost half the market price. Ukraine turned down this offer. A statement by Gazprom followed that it would now sell gas to Ukraine at the market price of $US 418.\nAs Europe depends on Russia for about a quarter of its gas supplies, and the fact that 80% of their supplies pass through Ukrainian pipelines, it is watching the ongoing conflict closely.\nAfter Russia had announced a new gas price for Ukraine, Viktor Yushchenko said it would be \u201clogical\u201d that transit costs should go up too. The Ukrainian leader said that talks with Russia are to be resumed shortly with the final agreement to be reached by the time of the Orthodox Christmas, January 7.\nA Ukrainian delegation has set off on a tour of Europe, which aims at informing the European Union about the gas situation and to provide guarantees that the gas will be transported across Ukraine as normal. Also, Ukraine's president Yushchenko has sent letters to the leaders of eight countries and to the European Commission to explain his reasons of the gas dispute.\nEarlier Ukraine had threatened to confiscate Russian gas passing through the country, refusing to guarantee supplies to Europe as Russia promises to stop gas supplies to Ukraine due to debts. Gazprom called Ukraine\u2019s reaction \u2018blackmail\u2019.\nAs Gazprom has vowed to maintain supplies to Europe in full, its gas will be entering Ukraine for the foreseeable future, at least until the Nord or South Stream is opened.\nOne major pipeline \u2013 bringing gas to Ukraine \u2013 passes through the town of Kursk, while a larger one \u2013 taking gas to Europe \u2013 operates in Voronezh (see picture).\nMeanwhile, German gas company E.ON Ruhrgas has taken precautions in case supplies of Russian gas are hampered. Its press secretary Helmut Roloff said that the company has agreed on additional gas supplies from Norway in case of emergency. Nevertheless, on Friday, they received all the gas they had ordered.",
        "Finland faces heightened risks from links between radical Islam and terrorism, according to a fresh report by Finland\u2019s security and intelligence police unit Supo. The unit points to the ongoing Syrian conflict as a source of the increased threat.\nAccording to the Supo assessment, in spite of the increased risk of radical Islam fomenting terrorism, Finland is still not a primary target for terrorist organisations.\nThe security police add that the risk of al-Qaeda-led attacks against Finland or Finns is still low, even though around 40 people have travelled from Finland to Syria to join Islamist groups there.\nAccording to Tuomas Portaankorva of Supo there is an ongoing traffic of fighters between Finland and Syria, with some returning from the war and others going back to Syria after a break in Finland.\n\"They can take on a more radical world view than before,\" said Supo head Antti Pelttari.\nThe evaluation of an increased threat refers to violence that may be perpetrated within local borders without external guidance. Interior Minister P\u00e4ivi R\u00e4s\u00e4nen says that Finland has around 200 higher-risk individuals.\n\"We have more of those high risk individuals, they have more contact to extremist ideologies and extremist actions,\" said R\u00e4s\u00e4nen. \"They have been there, received training. That's why this threat level has been raised.\"\nSupo said that there are more people in Finland with links to terrorist organisations. They unit reports increased numbers of people travelling to conflict areas in Syria as well as those who have returned from engaging in war tourism.\nAccording to Supo it has no information about concrete terrorism operations targeting Finland. However the intelligence organization has warned that the operations of networks with links to Syria and the activities of private individuals are unpredictable and difficult to anticipate.",

Drew Griffin, the CNN investigative correspondent whose reporting made VA health care delays a national news story, told me that the VA ignored questions from reporters at their peril.\nHis first attempt to reach VA secretary Eric Shinseki - who resigned under pressure on Friday - was way back in November. \"Basically, they have tried to shut down our reporting by refusing to talk to us,\" Griffin said. Here's the rest of the conversation.\n\"These are performances and if there's no one to perform to, if there's no audience, there's no reason to perform,\" Cullen said. He said the media should seek ways to \"take away part of the stage.\"\nGreenfield said he understood the impulse - \"I think it's an effort somehow to take away from these killers what we think they might want\" - but called it \"ultimately futile because in this day and age, unlike 40 years ago, there are no gatekeepers.\"\nI also talked with Cosmopolitan editor in chief Joanna Coles about the #YesAllWomen hashtag movement.\n3.

It's fought on a huge battlefield with great dangers everywhere and all kinds of strategy required.\"\n5. Bernstein also said this, when I brought up the fact that Clinton will be interviewed by Fox News hosts Bret Baier and Greta Van Susteren in mid-June: \"It's not just reach out to people who will need some persuading. It's the publicity that will be generated by the Fox interview and the expectation - by people in the Clinton retinue - that she is going to be able to run some circles around her interviewers. And I suspect - you never know - that that might well be the case.\"\n6. I interviewed Ta-Nehisi Coates (above) about his Atlantic cover story, \"The Race for Reparations,\" and about how racial injustices are covered by the media.\n\"I think race is covered in a way that we cover most things in the media, and that is that there is a bias towards spectacle,\" he said.\n\"Like, when Donald Sterling says something, that means something. When Cliven Bundy, this spectacle, says something, that means something. And this presents great difficulty for those of us who are concerned about the force of racism in American life, because much of it is not spectacle.\nHe added, \"But I think that is the challenger of any storyteller. You have to find some way to bring that to life and get across to people what's actually happening.\"\nHere's the video of our conversation.\nLet me know what you thought of the show.

After all, he'll need some cash to buy school supplies for Hogwarts.\nIn his vault, he finds out that he has piles and piles of gold galleons. Harry's rich! Way more rich than most of his friends. Why? The books don't really explain. But Rowling addressed the issue on Pottermore.\nIn the 12th century, Harry's ancestor Linfred of Stinchcombe developed pharmaceutical remedies that were the basis for Skele-gro and Pepperup Potion. He built a business out of it, and the Potter family maintained the fortune for generations. Some time later, Harry's grandfather Fleamont Potter \u2014 the son of the \"original\" Harry Potter \u2014 quadrupled the family fortune with hair potion. The hair potion is even advertised in a stray newspaper in \"Fantastic Beasts.\"\nGringotts does exchanges between magical and muggle money.\nA Gringotts goblin from \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.\"\nAs J.K. Rowling pointed out, it's the only way Muggle-born wizards and witches could buy wands, since Ollivanders only takes galleons, knuts, and sickles \u2014 not pounds or euros.\nThere's one character from the books who existed in real life.\nAn engraved portrait of Nicolas Flamel.\nIn Rowling's series, Nicolas Flamel is the alchemist who created the Philosopher's Stone, the magical object at the center of \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\" that can grant a person immortality.\nIn real life, Flamel was a French scholar and bookseller who lived in the 14th and early 15th centuries. After his death, he got a reputation as an alchemist who secretly achieved immortality. Rowling wrote about the inspiration on Pottermore, where she said Flamel attended the French wizarding school Beauxbatons in her version of his life.\nGreen gloves were used to make the books fly around in the Hogwarts library.\nEmma Watson as Hermione in \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.\"\nFor the movies \u2014 particularly a scene in \"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince\"\u2014 the books in the Hogwarts library have a knack for organizing themselves on shelves. The secret behind the magic is that green gloves were used. They worked the same way green screen does, and were wiped away in post-production so it looked like the books floated on their own.\nThere were two Harry Potters.\nThe Mirror of Erised scene in \"Sorcerer's Stone.\"\n\"Henry Potter (Harry to his intimates), was a direct descendant of Hardwin and Iolanthe, and served on the Wizengamot from 1913 - 1921. Henry caused a minor stir when he publicly condemned then Minister for Magic, Archer Evermonde, who had forbidden the magical community to help Muggles waging the First World War. His outspokenness on the behalf of the Muggle community was also a strong contributing factor in the family's exclusion from the 'Sacred Twenty-Eight.'\"\nThe original Harry Potter didn't show up in the books, but he lived around the time of \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.\" So don't rule him out for a surprise appearance in the movie series.\nThe film designers have been hiding a secret character in the movies' fake newspapers.\nWhat does Harry know about the Ginger Witch?\nThe Fourth Estate is an important part of Rowling's universe. The Daily Prophet covers magic in Britain and The New York Ghost covers the same in the United States.\nIn almost every \"Harry Potter\" movie, it was the design firm MinaLima that put together the fake newspaper props for different scenes. They had fun with it. Throughout the series, you can spot stories about \"The Ginger Witch.\" She's a hooligan with a multinational criminal past spanning decades.\n\"We know now that things do get seen,\" designer Miraphora Mina told INSIDER. \"In the past, we didn't realize how much these would be scrutinized by fans.\"\nRead about all of the Ginger Witch's exploits here.\nThere's a perfume company that exists in the background of both the \"Harry Potter\" and \"Fantastic Beasts\" movies.\nDumbledore in front of a Divine Magic poster in \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\" and a poster for the same brand featured in \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.\"\nAnother one of MinaLima's inventions is the Divine Magic perfume company. We first see it in a poster behind Albus Dumbledore in \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\" when he meets with Harry at the beginning of the film. In \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,\" there's a street poster advertising the same brand more than half a century earlier.\nBefore becoming headmaster, Dumbledore was a Transfiguration teacher at Hogwarts.\nMichael Gambon as Albus Dumbledore.\nDumbledore is an academic and something of a magical genius. As his chocolate frog card attests, he's \"particularly famous for his defeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel.\" So it makes sense that he was a teacher at the wizarding school, not just the administrator.\nIt was while Dumbledore was a Transfiguration teacher that Tom Riddle \u2014 later to become Lord Voldemort \u2014 attended Hogwarts. He also taught Newt Scamander, the main character in \"Fantastic Beasts,\" with whom he has a close bond. An issue of the publication \"Transfiguration Today\" in the movie has an article featuring his work. Jude Law is slated to play Dumbledore in the forthcoming \"Fantastic Beasts\" movies, which will be about taking down his rival Gellert Grindelwald.\nNewt Scamander was a Hufflepuff.\nScamander's scarf gives it away.\nSpeaking of Newt Scamander and Hogwarts, the character \u2014 played in \"Fantastic Beasts\" by Eddie Redmayne \u2014 was sorted into the Hufflepuff house. You might have spotted his canary-and-black scarf throughout the movie, signaling Hufflepuff's colors.\nJ.K. Rowling wanted \"The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore\" to look like \"a trashy airport novel.\"\nThe cover of \"The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore.\"\n\"The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore\" was a biography written by Rita Skeeter, a gossip columnist hell-bent on destroying his reputation. For the movies, Rowling wanted to reflect the poor, salacious quality of the book. So she told MinaLima to make it overwrought like \"a trashy airport novel.\"\nMACUSA president Seraphina Picquery has a big throne that looks like Dumbledore's from Hogwarts.\nHer golden throne in \"Fantastic Beasts\" was intentionally made to be a visual reference to Dumbledore's in Hogwarts's Great Hall.\n\"There were props designed to connect the film back to the 'Harry Potter' series,\"supervising modeller Pierre Bohanna wrote in \"Inside the Magic: The Making of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.\"\nColin Farrell didn't read a single page of \"Harry Potter\" before reading J.K. Rowling's script for \"Fantastic Beasts.\"\nHe watched the movies, though.\nFarrell told SFX Magazine earlier this year that he was a big fan of the \"Harry Potter\" movies, but he didn't read any of J.K. Rowling's work before reading her script. He wanted to play the role of auror Percival Graves based on that screenplay alone.\nThere's a good reason the Horcrux inside Harry wasn't destroyed in \"Chamber of Secrets.\"\nHarry getting bitten by the basilisk in \"Chamber of Secrets.\"\nFor years, \"Harry Potter\" fans wondered what, exactly, was going on with the portion of Voldemort's soul that was inside Harry. When Voldemort tried and failed to kill Harry himself, he ended up inadvertently leaving a Horcrux inside him.\nBut if that's the case, why wasn't it destroyed when the Basilisk in \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\" bit Harry, just as its poison-infused fang destroyed the horcrux that was in Tom Riddle's diary?\n\"A Horcrux can only be destroyed if its container is damaged beyond repair,\" Rowling explained. \"Harry was healed by Fawkes. Had he died, the Horcrux would indeed have been destroyed.\"\nMany of the spells are derived from Latin roots.\nWhen coming up with magical spells, Rowling clearly worked her studies of Classical language and mythology at the University of Exeter. Many of them are based in the Latin language. \"Accio,\" for example, sounds like \"accerso,\" which means \"to summon or fetch.\" \"Wingardium Leviosa,\" the summoning charm, from from the word \"wing\" (referring to flight); \"ard\" (from the Latin \"aardus,\" which can mean \"elevated\"); and \"levi\" (which means \"to lift\").\nJ.K. Rowling wrote a \"Harry Potter\" prequel short story \u2014 and the original copy was stolen.\nIn 2008, Rowling hand wrote an 800-page story about James and Sirius Potter noodling around on magical motorcycles and escaping some muggle cops. You can read it here. She auctioned it off for charity, but in April of 2017, that handwritten draft was stolen and it hasn't been found to this day.\nAlbus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore has a specific meaning for each of his names.\nYes, that's his full name.\nRowling is famous for her memorable, magical character names. She's put a lot of thought into them, and a lot of the names refer to some deeper meaning for each character. Dumbledore, as the character with the most names, might be the best example.\n\"Albus\" is Latin for \"white,\" which could be symbolic or just refer to his beard. \"Percival\" was one of King Arthur's Knights of the Round Table, who went in search for the lost grail. \"Wulfric\" may be a reference to the 12th-century British figure Wulfric of Haselbury, who was known as a miracle worker. And \"Brian\" is often thought to be derived from an Old Celtic word that roughly means \"noble.\"\n\"Dumbledore\" is one name that Rowling has discussed explicitly. It's an Old English word for \"bumblebee.\"\n\"Because Albus Dumbledore is very fond of music, I always imagined him as sort of humming to himself a lot,\" Rowling said in a 1999 interview.\nSome of the food in the movies was real.\nOne of the highlights of the \"Harry Potter\" movies and books are the feasts in the Hogwarts Great Hall. Shepherd's pie, Yorkshire pudding, and pumpkin juice seem to be served at every meal. During the epic feast scene in \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,\" many of the dishes were actually cooked up for a more realistic effect. In general, the food was fake and made with resin.\nThe glass bottles in Snape's potions classroom was filled with really weird stuff.\nThere's probably gross stuff in there.\nThe movie's set designer found things like tufts of hair and unwanted guts and bones from local butchers for the potion ingredient vials. The room itself also expanded between movies, making room for more extras in later entries in the series.\nFour different owls played Hedwig, Harry's owl, in the movies.\nMore than 12 rats played Scabbers, Ron's pet rat, four cats played Hermione's pet Crookshanks, and nine Neapolitan Mastiffs played Hagrid's dog, Fang.\nMovie producers stood in for the Hogwarts moving portraits.\nThe portraits that line the walls of Hogwarts castle in The Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Studios, Orlando.\nOne of the magical castle's features is that it has paintings that move. Some of them had plot significance, like the Fat Lady in \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,\" who was played by comedian Dawn French. Others, though, were played by the movie's producers, who wanted to immortalize themselves in some way on screen.\n15,000 glass orbs were made for the Room of Prophecy scene in \"Order of the Phoenix.\" None of them were used.\nYou can still see the orbs on the Warner Bros. studio tour in London.\nIn the end, the producers decided to digitize the whole thing and none of the orbs made it to the movies.\nThe Black family tree wasn't canonized until the \"Order of the Phoenix\" movie.\nThe Black family is one of the oldest and most important in the wizarding community. There's Harry's godfather, Sirius Black, who's cousins with Voldemort's right-hand woman, Bellatrix Lestrange, and there's also Regulus Arcturus Black, who tried to destroy one of Voldemort's Horcruxes, and Phineas Nigellus Black, a former headmaster of Hogwarts.\nIt's confusing, and the books refer to a big tapestry in 12 Grimmauld Place, Sirius's family home, that features a family tree that lays it all out. But the actual content of that tapestry isn't entirely included in the books, so there are some gaps.\nFor the \"Order of the Phoenix\" movie, designer Miraphora Mina needed to include the tapestry in one of the scenes. So she called up J.K. Rowling, who mapped out the entire Black family for her. It's only from the movie that we have all of the relationships specified.\nIt took six months to design the Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes scene in \"Half-Blood Prince.\"\nA display of packaging from Weasleys' Wizarding Wheezes.\nThe joke shop \u2014 which Harry, Ron, and Hermione go to at the beginning of the movie \u2014 is filled with whizzing magical pranks, bubbling potions, and everything from Anti Gravity Hats to Self-propelling Custard Pies. It's a feat of imagination and hard work from Fred and George Weasley, and it all had to be re-created for the movie.\nMinaLima made the boxes and labeling for every single item. Everything in the shop had to look like it was manufactured and sold by the Weasley twins, and have a bit of backstory to it.\n\"It was a bit of a dream, really, to have six months to design a load of crazy packaging,\" Mina told INSIDER.",
        "The Eagles, after trading LeSean McCoy to the Buffalo Bills, might have found his replacement.\nA person with knowledge of the situation, who requested anonymity, told NJ Advance Media that the Eagles have expressed interest in free-agent running back Frank Gore.\nThat person said a deal with the San Francisco 49ers star could get done as early as Tuesday, the first day free agents can sign with another team.\nAt this point, teams are not allowed to offer contracts to free agents. It is not clear how much it might cost the Eagles to sign Gore.\nGore, 31, finished last season with 1,106 yards on 255 carries and four touchdowns. One of 13 running backs to gain more than 1,000 yards last season, he ranked 10th among backs in the NFL.\nGore ran behind one of the top offensive lines in the NFL. ProFootball Focus ranked the Niners' as the ninth-best unit in the league last season. The Eagles finished second overall on the list.\nHis 4.3 yards per carry average was nearly identical to McCoy's 4.2 yards per carry.\nGore had a season high 119 rushing yards and a 55-yard touchdown reception in the 49ers' Week 4 win over Eagles last season.\nHow much of the workload Gore will get next season remains to be seen. If he joins the team, it's likely he will be the most experienced player on the roster.\nThe Eagles' need for a running back increased when they traded McCoy last week. They have Chris Polk (who they tendered as an unrestriced free agent), Darren Sproles, Kenjon Barner and Matthew Tucker on the roster.\nThere were rumblings on Saturday that the team might be interested in New Orleans Saints running back Mark Ingram, but Ingram re-signed before being able to accept other offers.\nThe free agency period is expected to be a busy one for the Eagles, who have approximately $46 million in salary-cap space.",
        "GENEVA, Mar 18 2013 (IPS) - The current growth model is not sustainable. Neither the green economy nor alternative sources of energy can prevent global warming. Solutions will come from concerted actions at the local and national levels, from the adoption of instruments and practices borrowed from other disciplines like peacebuilding, and from the move to a \u201cno-waste economy\u201d, according to experts here.\nIn its milestone report, \u201cThe Limits to Growth\u201d, published in 1972, the Club of Rome warned that the human ecological footprint had grown dangerously quickly from 1900 to 1972. Shortly thereafter, the warning proved to be prophetic: by 1986 the human ecological footprint had overshot the carrying capacity of the Earth. At current production and consumption levels, we need 1.5 planets to survive; if everyone lived like a U.S. citizen, we would need five planets.\nLand, water and biodiversity continue to decline. Global CO2 emissions are on the rise. The oceans are warming and the sea level is rising continuously. Forest cover has decreased by 300 million hectares since 1990.\nIn his new book, \u201cThe Crisis of Global Sustainability\u201d, presented in Geneva on Mar. 15, Tapio Kanninen, co-director of a project on sustainable global governance at the City University of New York and member of the Club of Rome, warms that we cannot continue with the current model of economic growth whilst limiting global warming to two degrees Celsius.\nTechnology cannot help us \u2013 it would be environmentally damaging and too costly, he says. We cannot move to alternative sources of energy \u2013 the present alternatives like solar, nuclear and wind contribute relatively little of global energy needs and they are unlikely to replace fossil fuel completely. In short: humanity has reached a stalemate.\n\u201cMany U.N. summits after the (1987) Brundtland Commission have avoided concrete action,\u201d Kanninen said at the book launch Friday.\nThe recent Rio+20 Earth Summit held in Brazil this past June is just one example of the limitations of these international gatherings. Though thousands of participants had hoped the conference would generate concrete solutions and commitments to reducing global warning, the concluding document made no mention of the 30-billion-dollar fund need to transition to a green economy, nor did it outline a blueprint for sustainable development post 2015.\nMost of these summits draw very high-level attendance, but in the end industrialised countries\u2019 national interests dominate the bargaining universe. The global North wants to safeguard its neoliberal economic targets, while the South continues to defend its development goals.\nKanninen advocates for a second review conference of the U.N. charter and a complete paradigm shift.\nKanninen advocates abandoning the old approach of viewing sustainable development as a battlefield and adopting instead instruments from peace-building processes.\nYves Lador, consultant and representative of the U.S.-based Earthjustice at the U.N. in Geneva, told IPS on the sidelines of the book launch that this was an interesting approach.\n\u201cParticularly (with regards) to climate change, we need some trust building measures inspired by the disarmament agreements\u201d, through which governments allow outsiders to monitor their progress. He added that cross verification between different independent monitors could bolster the exercise.\n\u201cThis would be very useful because we don\u2019t know the reality of various countries\u2019 emissions. China, for example, does not make this data readily available. India has problems in data collection, but welcomes outside advice on how to share this data with the public.\nHe cited growing awareness of the link between climate change and human rights as a salient example of the right to information \u2013 namely, the right of the public to know the extent and impacts of climate change and to participate in decision-making.\nA circular economy is, by definition, a restorative economy: products should be designed for longer use and materials reused and recycled, which would increase the demand for maintenance and repairs. The concept has been around since the 1970s but it has gained momentum again due to the activities of the U.S.-based Ellen MacArthur Foundation and to \u201cBankrupting Nature\u201d, a recent report authored by Ander Wijkman and Johan Rockstr\u00f6m, co-president of the Club of Rome.\nHe believes an increase in services like leasing would compensate for the loss of jobs resulting from the decrease in production. Other major companies like Caterpillar have stopped selling huge trucks, and have begun to lease them.",

        "TURLOCK , Calif.--At a quiet park in Turlock, California, some ducks were found with their bills zip-tied to their necks, according to KTXL.\nDonnelly Park is a peaceful park in the middle of town. It's popular with families looking to spend some time by the water, under the trees.\nThe park is also home to several ducks.\nBut Sunday night, the ducks had something around their necks and Elizabeth Stevens took some pictures.\n\"I'm pretty sure someone did it to them, just how tight they were and how they were literally cut off as if someone tightened then and then cut it,\" Stevens said.\nThe zip ties were wrapped around the duck's neck, pinning its lower beak to its neck, its mouth open. Two of the animals had been bound in that same way.\n\"I thought it was pretty messed up. I don't understand why people would do that,\" Turlock resident Tyler White said.\nSo the group cut the ducks free.\n\"I couldn't catch them, she's the one who caught them,\" White said.\nThe story of the rescue has spread on social media, and while the friends are gratified by the support they've gotten, what's also clear is that it has restored a little of the faith they lost that night.\n\"So many people just saying 'thank you, you guys are good people.' And honestly, it's pretty heart-warming to know there's people that actually care,\" Stevens said.",
        "The federal government is accelerating Canada\u2019s transition to a lower-carbon economy, even as conservative politicians in the provinces vow to scuttle key measures that would support that effort.\nNatural Resources Minister Jim Carr endorsed an advisory council report Thursday that spells out an ambitious agenda of increasing energy efficiency, switching off fossil fuels and reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the country\u2019s oil and gas industry.\nThe Generation Energy report was produced by an advisory committee appointed by Mr. Carr after he hosted a conference last year on the need for a new Canadian energy strategy. The committee included representatives from the oil and gas industry and the electricity sector, as well as from clean energy and Indigenous organizations.\nThe panel declared that climate change is a growing danger, and that Canada must be part of a global transition to lower-carbon energy needed to avert the most catastrophic impacts.\nHowever, there is considerable political opposition to the Liberal government\u2019s climate-change approach. Conservative politicians argue that Ottawa and its allies among provincial governments are driving up energy costs for Canadians with carbon taxes while undermining the competitiveness of the domestic oil industry with levies and new regulations.\nDoug Ford will be sworn in as Ontario premier on Friday and has already said he will scrap the province\u2019s cap-and-trade system that not only puts a levy on carbon emissions but finances programs to help homeowners and businesses reduce their energy use. Alberta\u2019s United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney says he will move in a similar direction should he win an election scheduled for next spring.\nThe Generation Energy report is hardly a radical document; the panel\u2019s co-chairs are Merran Smith, president of the advocacy group Clean Energy Canada, and Linda Coady, chief sustainability officer for pipeline and natural gas giant Enbridge Inc.\nThe report includes no call for Canada to rely solely on renewable energy by a certain date; there is no direct attack on the oil sands industry nor opposition to industry\u2019s plan for three pipeline expansion projects that would increase volumes of Canadian crude to U.S. and offshore markets.\nHowever, it does lay out a daunting challenge for the country\u2019s oil and gas sector, which suffered from the global price collapse of 2014-15 and is recovering far more slowly than some international competitors.\nThe goal, it said, is for the Canadian oil industry to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions on a per-barrel basis below that of major competitors, while also reducing costs. To get there, the industry will have to make massive investments in new technology and innovation.\nThat\u2019s a tall order for oil sands companies whose production is among the most carbon intensive in the world, and whose cost structure is high. The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers complained recently that climate and other environmental policies are placing an increasing burden on its members that make it difficult to attract investment.\nIn an interview, Mr. Carr said the Generation Energy panel\u2019s conclusion are consistent with the Liberal government\u2019s approach, which emphasizes action on climate change and providing incentives for Canadians to use less energy and lower-carbon energy, while supporting the traditional fossil fuel sector.\nConservative MP Ed Fast slammed the Liberals for undermining the oil and gas industry as it pursues its environmental agenda. \u201cI find it appalling that the Liberals are taking reckless action that will only speed up the decline of the Canadian economy,\u201d the Conservative environment critic said.",
        "Page 11, 5 October 1878 \u2014 CRAFTSMEN IN FUR.\ncreations of fancy, and real in so many aspects, as the Pathfinder, as Leatherstockings, as La Longue Carabine ? Who has not Killdeer in an imaginary gun-rack, and, hanging on a peg in the store-house of memory, the blanket which the Delaware chief threw back, that he might display the tortoise on his breast to his ancient tribe ? Who has not seen, in air-drawn pictures, the cavern, with the sassafras screen, behind which the \" Palefaces\" lurked, while the deadly fight raged between the Mohicans and the Mingoes, who had \" dared to set the print of their mocassins in the woods \" that once owned the sway of the Delaware tribe ; the grave of Cora, beneath the young pines ; the dead Sagamore, attired in the full-dress of his tribe and rank, with the children of the Lenape listening for the lament from the stern old warrior, whose lips remain silent, as he looks his last on Uncas ? Do we altogether disbelieve in them, because a hundred writers have \" belittled \" the American Indians, and because modern followers of Fenimore Cooper in the frontier lands and on the path of the setting sun are merely animated by a spirit of butchery, and their records are usually lists of slaughter, whether of Indians, or of the animals that are being \"thinned out\" like them? No more than we altogether disbelieve in Man Friday, or accept special corre- spondents' accounts of Bagdad, in exchange for our own old notions of the glorified city where the hunchback lived who made that wonderful rally, after prolonged suffocation by a fishbone, which had such surprising results.\n\" The trees of many acres had been felled, and tho glow of a mild summer evening had fallen on the clearing, in beautiful contrast to the grey light of the forest. A short distance from the place whore Duncan stood, the stream had seemingly expanded into a little lake, covering most of the low land from mountain to mountain. The water foil ont of this wide basin in a cataract so regular and gentle that it appeared rather to be the work of human hands than fashioned by nature. A hundred earthen dwellings stood on the margin of the lake, and oven in its waters, as though the latter had overflowed its usual banks. Their rounded roofs, admirably moulded for defence against the weather, denoted more of industry and free-thought than the natives were wont to bestow on their regular habitations, much less on those they occupied for the temporary purposes of hunting and war The village appeared to be deserted, at least so Duncan thought for many minutes ; but at length ho fancied ho discovered several human forms advancing towards him on all-fours, and apparently dragging in their train some heavy and formidable engine. Just then a few dark-looking heads gleamed out of the dwellings, and the place Boomed suddenly alive with beings, which, however, glided from cover to cover so swiftly as to allow no opportunity of examining their humours or pursuits.\"\nthat shut it in, are fed by the everlasting snow, and in their turn feed the main river, broad, tortuous, and troubled, that cuts its way through the eastern boundary range by a deep oaten, and debouches by a cleft in the rocks, called \" The Gate of the Plains,\" into a vast open valley, which leads to the \"great American prairie.\" The banks of these streams are the still comparatively unmolested homes of the wonderful North-American beaver, of tribes of the strange creature who may be seen at his miniature industry in the Zoological Gardens, handling his invalu- able tail with incomparable skill, and presenting an absurd likeness to Cruikshank's Methodist parsons in the aspect of his damp and shiny bullet-head. Perhaps of all the captive creatures there, the beaver finds it hardest to reconcile himself to circum- stances, for his kind has a special and well founded abhorrence of man, so deep-rooted and so intelligent that the trapping of beaver, as a frontierman of great experience tells us, is a game of skill of the nicest description, and the faintest sus- picion of \" human taint\" upon the \"beaver medicine\" (its in- gredients are a secret) will disconcert the most careful arrange- ments, so that the trapper may as well move on at once .to a distant clime, for not only will he take no fur in the waters which the taint has touched, but the \" office\" will be given down stream. Mr. Campion was instructed in the art of beaver- trapping by the famous Captain John Connor, who is, notwith- standing his name, thoroughbred, and head chief of the Delaware Indians\u2014the tribe of Chingachgook and Uncas\u2014and he holds that as a sport it compares with every other field-sport, as chess does with most indoor games, combining the maximum of skill with the minimum of chance, for it is \" a con- test between acquired skill, knowledge, unremitting care and attention, and the natural instinct\u2014if we may not call it reason \u2014of the most sagacious, acute, and wary of all the brute creation.\"\nThe wariness of the object of their pursuit is a characteristic of the trappers also ; only after cautious observation has con- vinced them that the stranger is really one of the craft will they discuss its mysteries and requirements. Among the latter, am- phibiousness, or at least insensibility to every human ailment likely to be produced by wet and cold, seems to hold an important place. It is pleasanter to think of the wise and industrious creatures in the great solitudes, where no trapper has yet found them, if any such there be (and we believe there are, in the Alaska Territory, where the cold beats even the cupidity of the fur-bunter and the cruelty of the sportsman), where the deep waters and the impenetrable jungle on the river banks are all their own ; where unmolested they dam up their pools and build their houses, with winter bath-rooms, dwelling and store-rooms, and apartments appropriated to interesting events (which are frequent), without any risk of the head of the family coming home minus a hind or forepaw, left in a trap, according to the construction of the horrible instru- ment. Mr. Campion says the beaver is the only animal he is acquainted with who will amputate his own leg in order to escape from a trap ; but other frontiermen tell us that the wolverine exhibits similar sagacity and courage, when he gets into trouble. David Gamut was not annoyed by the sugges- tion of Hawkeye that the sweet singer had meditated teaching the canning beavers to sing to the praise and glory of God, but gravely opined that such intelligent creatures would be glad to thank their Creator, if they did but know how, for His gifts of skill and senses of scent and hearing so far beyond the human, even in a land where those senses are trained to their highest capacity, by constant need and ever present danger. We are reminded of David Gamut's notion, as we read of the beaver of Wet-Mountain Valley, of their spacious houses, with every convenience except air in them\u2014how do the creatures live without it ?\u2014which are entered by a round hole in the river bank a foot under water, with a vestibule varying from four to ten feet, leading to a circular basin four feet deep and of the same width, with a vaulted roof a foot above the level at which the water stands. \" This,\" Mr. Campion tells us, \"is the winter bath-room, its depth below the surface of the ground (the bank of the river being any number of feet high) and its distance back ensuring that the water in it will remain unfrozen.\" Surely the first man who violated the sanctity of a beaver's domicile by demolishing it from the top must have had some compunction, as well as much astonishment, awakened by the spectacle of the radiating passages and the admirably kept rooms in which the little family dwelt ! Surely he must have marvelled exceedingly at the stores of osier twigs, of the inner bark of cotton-wood trees, swamp maples, alders, and willows, cleanly cut, and neatly packed in the moist receptacle, where no frost could get at them, and the family food would remain fresh and tender until spring ! Mr. Campion tells us that the beaver is \" a good theoretical and practical engineer, who cuts down trees larger in proportion to his size than the greatest forest mammoths are to us, choosing them with great judgment, felling them to the exact spot required ; building dams capable of resisting mountain torrents, constructing dwellings showing some knowledge of hydrostatics, and not doing all these things invariably and always alike, as if instinctively only, but changing and adapting his ways and modes of proceeding according to the circumstances of each particular case.\" He is also a keen observer of his most suspected enemy, for an elaborately contrived scare- crow, made to imitate a man, and placed, club in hand, astride a ditch made by a party of diggers for mining purposes, and which took the water from a pool belonging to some beavers, so that it was lowered a few inches, failed to deter them from effectually damming the ditch. They simply pulled the dummy down, took his club from him, cut off his stone feet, floated him down the ditch to a spot where there was a short flume, stuffed him into it, middle first, tucked his head and legs into the corners, and plastered all the crevices up neatly with river-mud. Thus did the beavers \" outsmart\" the men, the beavers no doubt having a Havelock or a Wolseley for their leader, in that favoured portion of the wilderness. Mr. Campion has watched them making their wonderful dams\u2014getting well out of scent, or they would have disappeared in an instant\u2014and amazing as the whole process is, has been most puzzled to conceive how they can estimate the height of a standing tree, since they cannot climb, and the absence of stumps in the scene of their operations shows that they never cut down one which is too short to reach from bank to bank of the stream they mean to dam. Authority worthy of respect has said that the beaver does not use his tail as a trowel, but Mr. Campion opposes this statement with the testimony of his sight. \"Many times,\" he says, \"I have seen the unmistakable print of the beaver's tail on his mud-mortar.\" The construction of these wonderful dams varies in excellence ; there are beavers who scamp their work. Are there contract houses among them, and is their \" lath and plasture \" ever, like that of Miss Miggs's garret, warranted \"not to bear, but the contrairy ?\"\nThese clever, diligent, provident creatures are among the inno- cent and happy races of the animal world. The fierce beasts in the jungle on the river-banks may prowl over their hidden homes, but cannot harm them, and they harm no living thing. Their intense pleasure in the mysterious perfume which forms an in- gredient of the \" beaver medicine \" seems to be one of the cunning cruelties of Nature, like the attraction of the winged-insect tribes to the deadly flame. They are merry, too ; their system is not that of all work and no play (which seems to be a defect of the ant tribes, unless, indeed, it be applied exclusively to the servile races), and the human watcher, from a distance which renders the \" taint \" impossible, may see them, when the moonlight silvers the wastes and the waters, climbing out in groups upon the banks, chasing each other playfully, with funny antics, plunging, dipping, and splashing with their broad, flat tails ; laughing and talking, too, no doubt, after a fashion of their own, and knowing nothing of that which decrees that beaver bonnets shall \" come in\" again and sealskin jackets be trimmed with sleek, fine, beaver fur.",
        "Smartphones can play a very positive role as a new tool with ophthalmologists, shows a new study conducted by the Emory University.\nSmartphones can be extensively used by ophthalmologists for viewing complex inner eye photos for diagnostic purpose. They can also be used for taking, sending and viewing pictures of the damage to the front of the eye or eyelids.\nThe study was conducted among some 350 patients who reported issues like headaches, eyesight changes and similar vision problems in emergency rooms.\nThe study also included the inner-eye photos taken by the ER staff using an ocular camera.\nThen the study team assessed the response of two ophthalmologists who viewed and rated the pictures on a desktop PC and did the same on an iPhone.\nThe results of the study, published in the Archives of Ophthalmology, show that the doctors found the iPhone images good or better than desktop images and rated them high.\nWhile one ophthalmologist felt 53 pictures were of the same quality, he found 46 better on iPhone and just one was better on PC.\nFor the other ophthalmologist who participated in the study, 56 were of equal quality, while 42 were better on iPhone leaving only two better on PC.\nThe study team thinks that it is possible that smartphones can be used in ophthalmic treatment as a new tool with which hospital staff can send the photos from the ER to the doctor\u2019s smartphone for consultation. And later maybe, somebody can make an app for that.\nThe team is planning to extend its study about this possibility.",
        "I love how old movies portray New York City at Christmastime. Snow drifts gently to the ground. Carols are sung on street corners. Decorations light up the streets. And the tree at Rockefeller Center seems to spread it's magic throughout the city, creating a scene straight out of the carol Silver Bells.\n\u201cChildren laughing, people passing, meeting smile after smile.\u201d I love how old movies portray New York City at Christmastime.\nBut I grew up in New York. And the city is nothing like that at Christmastime. The tree does light up Rockefeller Center and decorations line the streets. If you're lucky you'll get a nice snowfall. But what gives the city in those old films the spirit of Christmas is the people. The \u201cchildren laughing\u201d and the \u201csmile after smile.\u201d Ralph Kramden described it best in the Christmas episode of The Honeymooners, \u201ceveryone's hustling someplace. But they don't hustle around Christmastime like they usually do. You know they're a little more friendlier \u2026 they bump into you, they laugh and they say, 'Pardon me. Merry Christmas.'\u201d It's a lovely idea but in reality New York is New York. You can put up the decorations, you can have a pretty snowfall, you can even put carolers on the streets. But everyone's still hustling just like they always hustle. And don't count on getting any Merry Christmases now \u2013 we're far too \u201ctolerant\u201d for that.\nSo I spend my Christmases at home with people who I can count on to be merry. And I look forward to the end of January when I will go to another city that I can count on to be filled with the Christmas spirit.\nThat city is Washington D.C. It's not the city itself that creates the Christmas feeling. I've been living in the area for a couple months now and I think it's safe to say that for 364 days of the year it's more or less the same as New York. But in the second to last week of January it is slowly imbued with a Christmas-like cheer, which typically reaches a crescendo on January 22.\nThis date is home to the annual March for Life, a rally comprising hundreds of thousands of people gathered to protest the killing of unborn children. It's a grave cause that brings us to Washington and so one might reasonably expect the gathering to be grave. But we have so many reasons for joy. We see that we are not alone. All year, on our own, we fight for life in the world \u2013 a cold, hard world which beats us down. But on this day we see that we are supported by hundreds of thousands of others, that we are never alone in this fight. And with each passing year we know that the institution of abortion is being chipped away until one day it will crumble before our eyes, as every other form of oppression, from Auschwitz to the Berlin Wall, has crumbled before it.\nBut the real source of our joy is that we are celebrating life! And this is what gives the March for Life that Christmas-in-New York feeling. Because what is Christmas but the celebration of life? It is the celebration of the birth of a child. It is the celebration of a woman in a difficult, unplanned pregnancy choosing life. And it is the celebration of the source of life coming into the world to restore life to fallen humanity.\nAt the March for Life we celebrate the birth of every child. We celebrate the courage of every woman who has chosen and will choose life. We celebrate the conversion and healing of every woman who stands at the front of the March proclaiming \u201cI regret my abortion.\u201d And at the heart of it all we simply celebrate the mind-boggling gift that is life itself.\nClare Hinshaw is a graduate of Franciscan University of Steubenville.

        "Many people think the secret to great cooking is mastery of technique.\nIt helps, but it's hardly crucial. The key to cooking that tempts and satisfies, that brings people to the table, then brings them back for more, is understanding flavors and how they work together.\nAnd while a culinary degree certainly helps one understand this, more important is a willingness to try new foods, as well as old foods in new combinations. Now there is a book to help you take that flavorful trip.\nFlavor masters Karen Page and Andrew Dornenburg have compiled an encyclopedic primer to flavor. Their just-released \"The Flavor Bible\" not only explains what foods taste like, it also offers exhaustive lists of flavor pairings for each.\nThey suggest mascarpone, for example, which goes nicely with almonds, ladyfingers and peaches, among many other options. They also suggest pairings to avoid, such as maple syrup and brown sugar (too intense).\nThe first two sections of the book explain how flavor works and offer advice from chefs and others about how they pair various flavors to create great recipes.\nIt's one of the rare cookbooks without recipes that everyone should learn to cook from.",
        "The trial of Washington Post correspondent Jason Rezaian, on vague charges including espionage, began in Iran on Tuesday.\nOn Tuesday, the trial of Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, who has been imprisoned for nearly 10 months in Iran on vaguely defined charges, started in Tehran.\nAccording to Iran\u2019s official news agency IRNA, Rezaian is accused of committing \"espionage for the hostile government of the United States\" and spreading anti-Iranian propaganda. Those charges had not been made public until last month, after Rezaian had already spent nine months in prison.\nThe 39-year-old correspondent was detained in late July of last year, along with his wife and two photojournalists. The other three were later released, but Rezaian has remained in Evin Prison, one of the country\u2019s most notoriously inhumane facilities, and reportedly kept in isolation and denied medical treatment.\nThe Iranian government is presenting two pieces of evidence of espionage, Mr. Rezaian\u2019s brother, Ali Rezaian, said: an American visa application for Yeganeh Salehi, Jason Rezaian\u2019s wife, an Iranian citizen and a journalist, and a form letter sent by Mr. Rezaian to Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 White House transition team offering help to improve relations between Iran and the United States.\nRezaian, who grew up in California and holds dual American-Iranian citizenship, was only allowed to meet with his lawyer once\u2014she reportedly found out the date of the trial through Iranian media. If convicted, Rezaian could face up to 20 years in prison.\nBut one potentially telling detail about the otherwise mysterious proceedings is the judge assigned to the case. \u201cThe presiding judge, Abolghassem Salavati, is known for handing down harsh sentences and is accused by human rights groups of cracking down on journalists and activists,\u201d the BBC reported. \u201cHe has been dubbed the \u2018judge of death\u2019 for imposing several death sentences after the 2009 post-election opposition protests.\u201d In 2011, Salavati was placed on a European Union blacklist for human-rights abuses, and last year, he was also accused of leading a crackdown on political activists and journalists within the country.\nAs the United States and Iran continue to pursue a nuclear deal, some have suggested that Iran could be using Rezaian as a bargaining chip to enhance its position in the negotiations.\nThroughout the nuclear talks, U.S. officials have frequently brought up Rezaian\u2019s case as well as those of other American citizens currently being held in Iran. A number of Republican lawmakers have issued statements calling for the release of Rezaian as a precondition for a nuclear deal with Iran.",
        "California is lifting its drought emergency for most of the state after a winter of record rain and snowfall that followed a five-year dry spell.\nGov. Jerry Brown's office announced Friday that his executive order will lift the drought emergency in California, except for Fresno, Kings, Tulare and Tuolumne counties. Those counties still face groundwater supply shortages.\n\"This drought emergency is over, but the next drought could be around the corner,\" Gov. Brown said. \"Conservation must remain a way of life.\"\nBrown's office also said new legislation will create long-term conservation measures as the state with a history of dry spells anticipates future droughts.\nAbout 8 percent of California is still under some type of drought, according to the most recent U.S. Drought Monitor report. At this time last year, more than 90 percent of California fell into at least one of the weekly report's four drought categories.\nMore than 31 percent of California was in the most severe category -- exceptional drought -- in April 2016. That figure dwindled to 18 percent during the height of winter's storms before falling away later in the season.\nThe only parts of California that remain in moderate drought are northern Los Angeles, Ventura, Santa Barbara and Orange counties. A sliver of extreme southeastern Imperial County remains under severe drought.\nThe announcement ends the 2014 emergency declaration during California's driest four-year period on record. It led to the first conservation rules for the nation's most populated and agriculturally productive state, focused on turning off sprinklers and ripping out thirsty lawns.\nMonster storms this winter doused the Sierra Nevada Mountains with a record snowpack, a key California water source, and boosted reservoirs to normal levels. Melting water runs off the mountain and into a system of aqueducts and reservoirs, providing water for about 23 million Californians.\nWater conservation will become a way of life in the nation's most populated state, Felicia Marcus, chairwoman of the State Water Resources Control Board, who led conservation planning. Officials already have started charting long-term rules to make California more resilient as climate change makes weather patterns more severe.\n\"There's a greater appreciation of just how precious water is,\" she said. \"We've got to plan for longer droughts.\"\nCities and water districts throughout the state will be required to continue reporting their water use each month, said the governor order, which also bans wasteful practices. New rules are expected to permanently ban wasteful practices, such as hosing off sidewalks and watering landscapes in the days after it rains.\nSusan Atkins of the charity Self-Help Enterprises said the drought is not over for more than 900 families who have large water tanks in their yards because their wells dried up during the years long drought.\nMost of them are in Tulare County, a farming powerhouse in central California's San Joaquin Valley. Atkins said she still receives calls from people whose wells are running dry and need a tank and bottled water.\n\"In no way is it over,\" she said of the drought. \"We will run out of money before we run out of people that need help.\"\nAs for the robust snowpack, it might grow this weekend when an unusually strong spring storm sweeps through California. Electronic monitors last week showed the mountain snowpack was at 164 percent of normal.\nIt was the most dense springtime snowpack since 2011, a year followed by five years of drought.\nRecord-breaking rain in recent months has put a major dent in the drought but also led rivers and creeks to break their banks and wreaked havoc on the state's infrastructure. In February, drought busting storms led to an emergency evacuation of thousands of people downstream from Oroville Dam, where the main spillway broke apart and an emergency spillway eroded. In San Jose, thousands of residents were evacuated a flooded streets filled with mud and debris.",
        "Okay, okay, so maybe Delly wouldn\u2019t fall that far down the list. But still, a Matthew Dellavedova\u200b biopic? That seems\u2026random. And yet, it\u2019s apparently going to be real thing!\nAccording to Fox Sports Australia, Dellavedova and his Australian manager Bruce Kaider have teamed up with Los Angeles producers Zachary Green and Jason Shuman to create a film about Delly\u2019s life. It will focus on his upbringing in Australia and lead right up into the present day, which has taken Dellavedova to the magical city of...Milwaukee. No, but seriously, Kaider is promising that there will be plenty of intriguing stops along the way.\n\"Delly\u2019s inspirational story about overcoming the odds is one everyone can relate to,\" Kaider said in a press release, according to Fox Sports Australia. \"In real life, it played out just like a movie.\"\nDellavedova added that he\u2019s looking forward to getting started on the film. \"I am honored that Bruce, Zachary, and Jason think enough about my journey to turn it into a feature film,\" he said. \"I am thrilled to be working with this incredible group to tell my story to inspire kids around the world to dream big and that hard work and perseverance pays off.\"\nThe press release about the biopic suggested the filmmakers are going to try and emulate movies like Hoosiers and Rocky when they create the film, which seems like it\u2019ll be an impossible task. But then again, Delly is a guy who most people hadn&apos;t even heard of until 2015, and he somehow managed to finesse a four-year, $38 million contract this past offseason and now a movie about his life.

        "CHICAGO -- A three-year-old boy died after a fire swept through his South Side home Sunday, police said.\nFirefighters arrived at the three-story building on the 6700 block of South Dorchester Avenue two minutes after receiving calls of a fire, officials said. Three-year-old Maqkwone Jones was pulled from a second floor apartment and rushed to Comer Children's Hospital after suffering from cardiac arrest. He later died in the hospital.\nThe three-story building was mostly unoccupied at the time of the fire, according to the Chicago Fire Department, with people living in two of the 16 units. Thick, dark smoke could be seen from a distance as firefighters worked to stop the flames from jumping to neighboring buildings. In total, more than 100 firefighters joined in battling the blaze.\n\u201cThe flames were just everywhere. It looked like it was spreading from the building to the next building over,\" Ryan Booker, a neighbor, said.\nA man who lived in the building was treated for smoke inhalation, while a Chicago firefighter was taken to Northwestern Memorial Hospital as a precaution after showing signs of heat-related exhaustion.\n\u201cWe believe it was fatigue, overheating.

        "History is filled with stories of bold pioneers who changed the world with their visionary ideas. There exists also, in the annals of innovation, a rich tradition of mad scientists with crazy inventions. These two notions are not mutually exclusive. In fact, many celebrated breakthroughs were initially met with scorn and ridicule. We've compiled 11 such world-famous ideas from the history of science and technology. The temptation, of course, is to include those ideas that were scorned and should have stayed scorned. The Star Wars prequels, say. But we're trying to run a classy operation here.\nHeliocentrism Galileo Galilei, sometimes called the Father of Modern Science, was among the first and most famous to pay a price for his crazy scientific ideas. Galileo publicly promoted the Copernican concept of heliocentrism -- that the Earth revolves around the Sun -- back when the Church and even most fellow mathematicians held to geocentric model. Unfortunately, in 17th century Rome, such radical ideas were quite literally heresy. Galileo was forced to recant and spend the rest of his life under house arrest.\nTelephone The question of who actually invented the telephone has inspired a small library full of academic research. But at least one of the earliest telephone prototypes was met with official scorn. In 1860, a full 16 years before Alexander Graham Bell's patent, German schoolmaster Johann Phillip Reis constructed a prototype \"telephon\" and sent the details to a prominent scientific journal. The editors scoffed at the idea of telephonic transmission and Reis' paper was rejected out of hand. Evidence of Reis' work was later suppressed during the telephone patent wars of the 1870s.\nAlternating current As the Reis incident suggests, sometimes public reaction to a new idea is influenced by the competition. In the 1880s, lawmakers and the general public literally feared the use of alternating current (AC) for electric power distribution. AC power was considered dangerous, largely due to an orchestrated public relations campaign by Thomas Edison, who had financial interests in the competing direct current (DC) model. Edison even went so far as to stage public electrocutions of animals to freak people out about alternating current. These demonstrations later led to the invention of the electric chair.\nRadio The Top 40 anthem \"We Built This City\" -- generally considered the worst song ever -- name-drops Guglielmo Marconi, the Italian engineer often credited as the inventor of modern radio. Marconi didn't invent radio at all, actually. Scientists had been tinkering with the tech for years. But Marconi did champion the idea that long-distance radio transmissions could have profound cultural and commercial applications -- adult contemporary rock, for instance. Nevertheless, Marconi's vision was unappreciated at the time. In 1895, Italian officials routed his request for funding to the local insane asylum.\nVelcro In 1941, Swiss engineer George de Mestral was taking his dog for a walk when he began to wonder about those irritating burrs that tend to stick to your clothes (or your dog) on a hike. Being an engineer, de Mestral grabbed a microscope and the rest is history. His idea for a hook-and-loop fastener, now known as Velcro, was initially met with condescending skepticism by the European fabric industry. And as we all know, there are few entities more intractable than the European fabric industry. It took another 14 years to patent the \"zipperless zipper\" and in 1999, de Mestral was inducted into the Inventors Hall of Fame.\nPersonal computer It's hard to even wrap your head around now, but there was a time when the computer was viewed as an unknowable egghead machine with limited practical applicability for the common man -- like the electron microscope or the supercollider. The idea of a personal computer was crazy even to those in the business. \"I think there is a worldwide market for maybe five computers,\" said IBM chairman Thomas J. Watson in 1943. Supposedly. There's some debate over the veracity of this quote, but it does reflect the prevailing attitude of the time.\nCompact discs In the late 1970s, heavyweight competitors Sony and Philips worked together to develop the Compact Disc (CD) format, soon to revolutionize sound recording and distribution. Their biggest obstacle? A profoundly skeptical music industry, who insisted digital would never replace analog technologies like vinyl and cassette. Sony chairman Norio Ohga basically staked his career on the CD format. A classical music connoisseur, Ohga trusted his ear and promoted the CD's superior sound quality. Five years after debuting in Japan, the CD overtook the vinyl LP in total record sales.\nQuasicrystals Good ideas are sometimes dismissed at the molecular level. When famed Israeli scientist Dan Shechtman discovered quasicrystals in the 1980s, he was mocked and kicked off his own research team. Said one competing researcher: \"There is no such thing as quasicrystals, only quasi-scientists.\" Not a bad line, really, but Shechtman was vindicated rather spectacularly with a Nobel Prize in 2011. The discovery of quasicrystals changed ideas about the very structure of matter and now represents an entire field of study in materials science. Oh, and Schechtman just announced plans to run for the Israeli presidency.\nIphone and iPad Apple's triumphs in recent years have been so dazzling that its easy to forget the skepticism that preceded the company's flagship mobile products. Tech pundits and (especially) mobile phone executives ridiculed the iPhone concept of an all-in-one device in 2007. Even Apple's traditional rival got in on the action: \"There's no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share,\" said Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer in 2007. And remember the incessant jokes about the iPad's name back in 2010? Some joke: The iPad pretty much single-handedly resurrected the tablet as a viable mobile device.\nWearables History tends to repeat itself, so the obvious question is this: Which dubious technology of today will become the breakthrough of tomorrow? You can find plenty of skeptics dismissing the idea of wearables, always-on computing devices such as the smartwatch or Google Glass. Detractors can point to long list of failures in the wearable computing arena. But who knows? Perhaps our future cybernetic overlords will look back 100 years from now and regard wearables with digital fondness -- the breakthrough that sparked the inevitable robot revolution.

Among other things, Jose Antonio Vargas\u2019 story today makes that clear on a number of levels.\nOne is that people were willing to help him in a civilly disobedient way, starting with the woman at the DMV who whispered to him that his papers were fake rather than reporting him. Another is that whatever ultimately happens to Vargas, INS agents haven\u2019t rushed to his house to deport him ASAP. He\u2019s not currently sitting in a detention cell being questioned about what knowledge editors at the Washington Post and Huffington Post had of his immigration status. When Vargas pitched the story to the Post, they apparently rejected it, but they didn\u2019t turn around and immediately drop a dime on the guy.\nWhich is all just to say that the treatment of undocumented workers in this country is one of those things where we\u2019re only kinda sorta willing to enforce the law. Faced with a known quantity\u200a\u2014\u200aa friend, a colleague\u200a\u2014\u200anobody really wants to see a good person deported. Nobody really wants to make powerful people pay the price for complying with the law. And everyone knows we wouldn\u2019t really even have the logistical capacity to deport every unauthorized migrant in the United States if they all turned themselves in tomorrow. The undocumented and their friends and family and allies have, in other words, the potential to take the broken immigration and really smash it the point where it doesn\u2019t work at all. What the practical output of a crisis like that would be is difficult to say. But the point is that Washington basically doesn\u2019t want this on the agenda. Politicians want to talk about deficit reduction and posture about jobs. But undocumented people could in principle force their way onto the agenda if there was enough will and organization. And I think the experience of the filibuster-happy 111th Congress makes it pretty clear that if we are going to see dramatic legislative change on this front it\u2019s going to take something like that.",

        "IF you like cricket, and like a brainy writer whose intellectualism is friendly and endearing, you\u2019d better read this book. Mike Brearley was a cricketer with modest abilities, but he possesses a beautiful mind. Most creditably, excelling in cricket and studies at Cambridge didn\u2019t make him insufferable. His mind has trumped his batting feats, which are nondescript \u2014 1,952 international runs at an average of 23.23. But he is extraordinarily cerebral, and it\u2019s primarily due to this that he played 64 international matches, of which he captained in 56. His brain kept him in the team; if not captaining, he wouldn\u2019t have been in the team for so long. His leadership qualities were exceptional, his man management top-drawer \u2014 post-cricket, he became a psychoanalyst.\nBrearley remains acutely aware of his limitations as a player, as is most evident in the chapter on Viv Richards, the original King. Brearley writes with breathlessness and incredulity that Richards treated him as his peer. We all know Richards had and has no peers, and Brearley knows it too. Richards has respect for the intellect of Brearley. As a force for positive change in cricket, Brearley\u2019s intellect is respected and can be useful, which Richards recognises. Brearley is left awed by the encounter. \u2018I want him to like me,\u2019 he writes. \u2018I am almost surprised he remembers me, that he wants to talk to me. But I don\u2019t feel relaxed. I don\u2019t easily take in what he is saying. I have to listen hard. He is, as my colleague John Stephenson, also present, said afterwards, an alpha male. One can\u2019t imagine a woman not being fascinated. As a man (am I one?), older, in every sense paler, I am charmed, but also a tad intimidated, even by his friendliness.\u2019 Considering Brearley\u2019s high intellect, this extreme modesty seems unreal, artificial. But it\u2019s not fake, for Brearley is a very sincere, earnest man.\nBrearley is perhaps less intimidated when it comes to, say, invoking Socrates when discussing the aesthetics of the game.\nIn short, Brearley resides as easily on the intellectual plane of the sport as on the physical one.\nBrearley wears his intellectualism lightly. A few years ago, as we discussed depression among cricketers, he prefaced almost every sentence with \u2018I think\u2019, \u2018perhaps\u2019 or \u2018probably\u2019. When he speaks, he leaves room for a contrary or dissenting view, that\u2019s the generosity of his spirit. Doubt isn\u2019t necessarily a bad attribute.\nHe writes, too, with self-effacing simplicity, having a wry laugh at himself every now and then. Any traces of immodesty he might have had were summarily crushed by his father when he was a teenager, as he relates: \u2018I had been both arrogant and falsely modest, commenting to Mike Griffith and my father that my wicket-keeping was \u2018not quite as good as Mike\u2019s on the leg-side.\u2019 His father told him off, \u2018quietly\u2019. \u2018I felt and can still feel the shame,\u2019 Brearley writes. No wonder Brearley, 60 years on, is touched when the great Viv Richards doesn\u2019t fail to add \u2018I think\u2019 after expressing an opinion to him.\nThis book is valuable for several reasons. One reason is that it\u2019s full of anecdotes and contains affectionate and kind portraits of great players such as Bishan Singh Bedi, Sarfraz Nawaz, Richards, Dennis Lillee and Michael Holding. A more important reason is that it provides terrific food for thought, and can help one get a perspective on something important such as, say, racism.\nAbove all is Brearley\u2019s ability to put himself in someone else\u2019s shoes \u2014 and, more particularly, head. As a philosopher-cricketer, that\u2019s his greatest gift.",
        "September 2,2008: Hamas has an image problem, and it's getting worse. It's gotten so bad that the 30 year old son (Mosab Yousef) of one of the Hamas founders (Hassan Yousef) has not only renounced Hamas, but has become a Christian. Mosab is fed up with the terrorism/\"destroy Israel\" approach the Arab world has embraced over the last sixty years. Mosad notes, as have many other Arabs, that this has not worked.\nThe conversion angle is something Moslems are trying to keep quiet. Mosab Yousef's father pleaded with his son to keep quiet about the conversion (which took place 18 months ago). The elder Yousef knows that this is not an isolated incident. Many young Moslems are abandoning Islam. Most do so quietly. In Iran, the clerics that run the country are shocked at secret police reports about a growing number of young Iranians who have, in effect, abandoned Islam. This sort of thing is happening all over the Moslem world, but especially in Arab countries. The people who switch to Islamic radicalism get all the headlines, not the larger numbers who just walk away from Islam are largely ignored. In the Palestinian territories, there is also a growth in the number of Sunni Moslems who are switching to the Shia version (as championed by Iran). But many other Moslems are openly distancing themselves from the conservative forms of Islam (like the well funded Saudi Wahhabism). One reason this trend is kept quiet is because Islamic militants are inclined to kill such traitors, if the switch is done too openly. Thus the elder Yousef's plea that his son keep quiet, lest he attract the murderous attention of Islamic radicals out to impose the death sentence on apostates.\nHamas was founded in 1987, as one of the Palestinian terrorist organizations that believed attacking Israeli civilians was the way to victory. Hamas also noted (based on what happened to most of the first generation Palestinian terrorist organizations of the 1960s) that they needed more than violence to survive. So they sought out Moslem charities for donations, and ran many humanitarian programs. Once they had a steady stream of charity money coming in, they could divert some of it to terrorist activities. None of this worked. Israel defeated Hamas terrorism efforts twice (early 1990s, then once more a decade later). When Hamas won the Palestinian elections in 2006, and refused to drop its demand for the destruction of Israel (as non-Moslem donors, who provided most of the charitable contributions that kept the Palestinian state going, insisted), money dried up and the Palestinian government split into Hamas in Gaza (with 1.4 million people) and Fatah in the West Bank (with 2.4 million people). The Palestinians have managed to compile an impressive string of failures in the last half century, and many Palestinians are beginning to question the leadership and strategy.",

        "U.S. President George Bush waves to reporters Oct. 11, 1992 upon leaving the White House in Washington.\nRegardless of politics, most people will acknowledge that the late President George H.W. Bush, had all the most important qualities of a human being, and as an American.\nI\u2019m not going to recount here all the accomplishments of his long life of service to our country. You probably have read it all on Facebook and in newspapers, and have seen it in the news the last few days.\nWhat I remember most about President Bush is that he was a decent man.\nIt\u2019s not an exaggeration to say this holiday season is quite a stretch.\nObviously, he loved his dear wife Barbara from the day they met until his last breath. Even in the height of power as leader of the free world, he would exercise decency and was a true gentleman.\nI remember the victory in the first Gulf War, and how he built the large coalition of countries from around the world to push Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait. It was possible, in part, because of the relationships he had built over years public service.\nOne of the small things President Bush was known for was making you feel special when you were in his presence, no matter your place on the social or economic scale.\nAnother was his note writing. He would spend hours sending handwritten personal notes to those he met. From world leaders to a 6-year-old visitor to the White House, he made a point to connect with you.\nHarford County Public Schools Superintendent Dr. Sean Bulson has said on several occasions that the safety, security and mental well-being of the 38,000 HCPS students and 5,000 employees is his and the community\u2019s first priority. He said so again during a budget work session Tuesday evening.\nOn his last day in office as the most powerful man in the world, President Bush left a note to Bill Clinton, the man who after a brutal election had defeated beat him, removing him from office.\nThe note ends with: \u201cYou will be our President when you read this note. I wish you well. I wish your family well. Your success now is our country\u2019s success.\nI personally don\u2019t believe decency died with President George H.W. Bush.

        "Content protection features in Windows Vista are preventing customers from playing high-quality video and audio and harming system performance, even as Microsoft neglects security programs that could protect users, computer researcher Peter Gutmann argued at the USENIX Security Symposium in Boston Wednesday.\n\"If there was any threat modeling at all, it was really badly done,\" Gutmann, from the University of Auckland, New Zealand, said while giving a talk on Vista content protection. \"Once the enemy is the user and not the attacker, standard security thinking falls apart.\"\nVista requires premium content like high-definition movies to be degraded in quality when sent to high-quality outputs, so users are seeing status codes that say \"graphics OPM resolution too high.\" Gutmann calls this \"probably the most bizarre status code ever.\"\nWhile Microsoft's intent is to protect commercial content, home movies are increasingly being shot in high definition, Gutmann said. Many users are finding they can't play any content if it's considered \"premium.\"\n\"This is not commercial HD content being blocked, this is the users' own content,\" Gutmann said. \"The more premium content you have, the more output is disabled.\"\nGutmann, who wore a white T-shirt marked with a Windows Vista logo during his presentation, first issued his criticisms several months ago with a paper titled A Cost Analysis of Windows Vista Content Protection.\nGutmann's paper called Vista's content protection rules \"the longest suicide note in history.\"\nMicrosoft acknowledged that quality of premium content would be lowered if requested by copyright holders, the BBC reported. Microsoft defended its copyright protections after Gutmann's paper came out, saying they are common features of many playback devices, the BBC article says.\nThe protections allow copyright holders to prevent video from being played in high definition unless users have equipment that supports the High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP) digital rights management system developed by Intel. If PC users have graphics cards with video connections that don't support HDCP, they are out of luck.\nHigh-definition audio is also blocked in many cases, Gutmann said Wednesday.\n\"It's taking this open architecture that IBM created 25 years ago and making it closed again,\" he said.\nIn a 132-slide PowerPoint presentation, Gutmann outlined numerous features of Vista that he says are frustrating customers and programmers. New functionality related to content protection makes it hard to develop new drivers, he said. When ATI was finally able to ship Vista drivers, they crashed Windows, and Dell and Gateway had to delay Vista upgrades because they couldn't get working drivers, he said.\nGutmann said hardware costs will increase because vendors can't provide Vista-approved security functionality unless Hollywood studios like MGM, 20th Century Fox and Disney grant written approval saying the content security meets their standards.\nA Vista function known as \"tilt bits\" -- like the tilt sensor in pinball machines -- requires hardware and software drivers to report every minor glitch, even ones that cause no problems, Gutmann said.\n\"Every otherwise unnoticeable minor glitch is suddenly surfaced and turned into a showstopper,\" he said.\nSeparately, all the extra encryption required to meet Vista's content protection standards means some computer components can never enter power-saving mode, he said. Thus, when you play a movie your CPU keeps running at full steam, he said. The extra power demands make it hard to reduce electricity usage.\n\"It's a bit of an extreme claim, but you could say Windows Vista causes global warming, because it's burning so much power with all this nonsense,\" Gutmann said.\nThe encryption requirements render high-end graphics processing units less effective, he said, because the best of those products emphasize graphics performance over content protection. On Vista, US$100-video cards can thus outperform those that cost $1,000.\nGutmann argued that Microsoft placed content protection above all other priorities when building Vista, perhaps to gain favor and money from Hollywood. Microsoft should have instead focused this effort on security features that protect users, Gutmann said, such as encrypted paging to protect user secrets, protected content domains that keep out malware, and anti-debugging techniques to prevent rootkit hooking.\nNew Zealand's government, which has argued that digital rights management fails to address the rights of people and government, appears to be the only government worldwide to express public concern about Vista's content protection standards, Gutmann said.\nThis story, \"Vista Prevents Users From Playing High-Def Content\" was originally published by Network World.",

        "Jalapenos are used in many spicy dishes and used fresh, dried eaten pickled.\nJalapeno peppers are among the warm-season hot peppers of the Solanaceae family. Hot peppers, like jalapenos, need a long, warm growing season and grow best when planted outdoors as seedlings. You can enjoy fresh peppers or grow them to dry and use in your favorite dishes even if you do not have room for an outdoor garden. You can grow jalapenos in containers indoors and outdoors or grow them hydroponically.\nYou can grow jalapenos outdoors, starting two to three weeks after the last spring frost. Jalapenos require full sun, which is at least six hours of sun daily, and well-drained soil amended with organic matter. The proper pH level for jalapenos is 6.0 to 6.8, so to adjust, add limestone if the pH is low and peat moss if it is higher than 6.8. Sow jalapeno seeds 1/4 to 1/2 inch deep and space seeds or transplants 18 to 24 inches apart with two to three feet between rows. Water regularly to keep peppers evenly moist.\nJalapenos grow well in large containers if you don't have space in your yard. You need a large container, with a capacity of about 2 to 3 gallons. To successfully grow peppers in a container, they still need enough sunlight and proper care. You can use an all-purpose potting mix, but container plants still require more fertilizer and careful watering. Use a liquid fertilizer once a week and water the container to keep the soil moist. Put the container jalapenos where they will get at least six hours of sun a day.\nYou can grow jalapenos indoors hydroponically using a simple deep-water culture set-up. Peppers grow well with ebb and flow system along with rockwool slabs as a growing medium. Because pepper plants grow tall, they will need support to keep them from falling over. When grown hydroponically, the correct nutrient solution is important, so if you're new to hydroponics, it might be better to use a premixed solution.\nVegetables that grow well together in containers save space while still giving you variety. You can plant vegetables, such as jalapeno peppers, tomatoes and herbs together in one container, making it easy to grow ingredients for your favorite dishes or your favorite herbs for flavoring foods. When growing vegetables all in one container, give each plant plenty of room and leave enough space to accommodate plant growth. Simply fill a container with fresh potting mix, plant the vegetables, water and place in a sunny location.

        "HELENA \u2013 A state panel heard four hours of testimony Wednesday on bills relating to missing and murdered Indigenous women, an issue that proponents said affect all Montanans, but could have a profound impact on the Native American community.\nHouse Bill 21, known as \u201cHanna\u2019s Act,\u201d authorizes the department of justice to hire a missing persons specialist to work with local, state, federal and tribal law enforcement authorities on missing persons cases.\nThe specialist will help law enforcement and families in the search for missing persons, oversee entries into the database of the national crime information center of the U.S. Department of Justice and other databases to ensure records of missing persons are accurate, complete, and made in a timely fashion.\nHowever, they also noted it was not just a problem on reservations but statewide as well.\nThe bill, which would appropriate $100,000 to the general fund for each year of the biennium, would become effective July 1. The House Judiciary Committee heard the bill, along with three others Wednesday, but only took testimony.\nThe bill, sponsored by Rep. Rae Peppers, D-Lame Deer, is in remembrance of Hanna Harris, a Lame Deer woman killed in 2013 on the Northern Cheyenne Reservation.\nHer mother, Malinda Harris Limberhand, was among those who spoke to the committee, not only about HB 21 but on HB 54 as well, which requests all law enforcement agencies to immediately accept a report of a missing person unless there are extenuating circumstances.\nShe said she reported her daughter missing and was told by the police chief she was probably partying.\n\u201cTo this date I don\u2018t think she was ever put into a data base for missing persons,\u201d Limberhand said.\nBryan Lockerby, division administrator for Montana Department of Justice\u2019s Division of Criminal Investigation, said HB 54 provides help when issues about jurisdiction arise.\n\u201cThis is about closing loopholes and closing gaps and finding them in the system and getting them shut down,\u201d he said.\nA long line of people testified Wednesday on the four bills before the House Judiciary Committee, many of them becoming emotional.\nOther bills discussed included HB 40, creating the reentry cultural programming grant program and HB 48 to provide stacking of tribal court convictions for partner or family assault.\nThe hearing was capped by a rally in the rotunda of the Capitol and a news conference in the governor\u2019s reception room.\nGov. Steve Bullock called missing and murdered indigenous women an \"epidemic.\"\nHe said that nearly half the missing people cases in Montana are Native women. He said in 2013 there were 30 Native missing or murdered women in Montana.\n\"These are real lives and real people and for every single person going missing or murdered it has a ripple effect\" on the lives of others.\nHe said lawmakers have a moral obligation to deal with the issues.\n\"Never doubt the power of your voices,\u201d he said.\nPeppers said the lives and safety of Native women cannot be put on the back burner any longer.\n\u201cToo many of our sisters, mothers, and daughters have been left behind by our legal system,\u201d she said.\nPeppers said the people who testified Wednesday are seeking justice.\n\u201cThey are asking for answers,\u201d she said, adding that law enforcement does not take their losses seriously.\nRep. Casey Schreiner, D-Great Falls, the House minority leader, said the \u201cepidemic of missing and murdered Indigenous women could not be more urgent.\n\u201cGetting justice for these missing Montanans and their families is one of our top priorities. Democrats in the Legislature will not stop working until we get these bills across the finish line and deliver on our promises to Indian Country,\u201d he said.\nPeppers and others throughout the day said it wasn\u2019t just an Indian Country problem, this is a Montana problem.\nRep. Sharon Stewart Peregoy, D-Crow Nation, said hearing the testimony was difficult.\nU.S. Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., recently wrote a letter to the FBI and Bureau of Indian Affairs criticizing the handling of the case of 14-year-old Henny Scott of Lame Deer, who was found murdered in December. It took 13 days for law enforcement to notify the public that a missing persons report had been filed.\nOn Jan. 18, the House passed House Bill 20, that allows any law enforcement officer in the state to file a missing child report as soon as a child is reported missing.\nIt passed the House 97-0 on Jan. 21 and awaits a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.\nThese bills come as a record number of Native lawmakers are serving in Montana\u2019s Legislature this session, with the Montana American Indian Caucus having 11 tribal members, roughly 7 percent of the Legislature.",

        "Mismanagement and secrecy have stalled the war on terrorism\u2014and at home its effects reverberate against civil rights.\nIf September 11 was this generation's Pearl Harbor, the Bush Administration's war on terrorism is still in early 1942, when the news from the front was bad, and the home front was panicky and confused. Now the instant-gratification warriors of the press are rushing in to turn things around. Columnists William Kristol and Charles Krauthammer grumble that the Administration is operating under too many constraints. Impatience with the air campaign has sparked calls by the Sunday morning punditocracy to send in substantial ground troops beyond the small contingent already there. Senator John McCain calls for B-52 carpet-bombing. Polls show a rising number of Americans doubt the war on terrorism will succeed.\nOur concern is less about fine points of military strategy than about the possibility that the human and political costs of the war might outweigh any gains in national security and undermine America's moral credibility in the fight against the perpetrators of September 11. The bombing campaign may or may not be militarily effective\u2013who knows, since our only information comes from the Pentagon and Al Jazeera\u2013but civilian casualties are eroding support among coalition allies. TV pictures of devastated neighborhoods and wounded civilians fuel anger against America throughout the Arab and Muslim world and provide rallying cries for extremists, who could destabilize fragile governments in Pakistan, Indonesia and elsewhere. Sketchy reports from inside Afghanistan suggest that the bombing is turning people's loyalty back to the Taliban\u2013making more difficult any covert operations aimed at capturing the \"Evil One.\" It has sent waves of humanity to huddle on Pakistan's closed borders. As winter sets in, as many as 5 million face dire food shortages.\nAt home, Congress passes a counterterrorism bill \"without deliberation and debate,\" according to Senator Russ Feingold, the lone senator who cast a historic vote against the ill-named PATRIOT Act. The act grants the Feds sweeping powers that break down the firewall between intelligence-gathering and criminal justice. Nothing in the bill would have prevented the disaster of September 11. And yet Bush and House GOP leaders still balk at passing the one measure that could have: federalizing airport security. Meanwhile, the Justice Department continues to resist legitimate requests for information about the 1,107 people it has detained in connection with the September 11 attacks. Civil liberties organizations and others, including this magazine, have filed a Freedom of Information Act request for information about those detained, warning that the government's \"official silence prevents any democratic oversight of [its] response to the attacks.\" The government should comply.\nUltimately, the antiterrorism campaign could have disastrous consequences if America alienates its allies abroad and its people at home. The United States must reassure\u2013by words and deeds\u2013the majority of Muslims who oppose the terrorist attacks that the purpose of US military action is not to punish Afghans for the actions of Osama bin Laden. To this end, it should work more closely with the United Nations by curtailing military actions that hamper relief activities and by supporting UN efforts to build a coalition government that represents all parties in Afghanistan.\nPolls show that an overwhelming majority of Americans favor a multilateral effort against terrorists, including working through the UN. Add to this stepped-up international policing efforts that must be the backbone of any global antiterrorism campaign and financial countermeasures that target identifiable terrorist groups. As Jonathan Schell writes on page 8, \"In a war on terrorism\u2013as distinct from a war on a state\u2013it is politics, not military force, that will probably decide the outcome.\"",

        "PARIS (Reuters) - Finding friends and meeting new ones could become even more important uses for global positioning chips than getting from A to B as the technology spreads to cellphones in coming years.\nCombined with mobile Internet access, GPS (global positioning system) is seen in the industry as adding a new dimension to social networking that could also have implications for the media business.\n\u201cGPS tells me that today I\u2019m sitting somewhere at 48 degrees north, 2 degrees east. Is that really that much value if I know I\u2019m sitting in Paris?\u201d said Miles Flint, head of mobile phone maker Sony Ericsson.\nBut he saw that changing in future.\n\u201cOne of the more compelling things that we might use every day is the integration of that information into knowing where my friends are,\u201d he told the Reuters Global Technology, Media and Telecoms Summit in Paris this week.\nOnce people can physically find those they want to more easily \u2014 as long as those others want to be found \u2014 it can enhance the establishment of growing Internet social networks such as News Corp.\u2019s MySpace site.\n\u201c\u2018Your communities in your pocket,\u2019 I think that explains where we\u2019re headed quite well,\u201d Nokia Chief Executive Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo said earlier this month at a shareholders meeting.\nIndustry executives still disagree over how quickly satellite navigation will find its way into phones.\nThe chief executive of chip maker CSR, John Scarisbrick, told the Reuters Summit his company was expecting to see a quick uptake of GPS chips in phones as prices fall.\nBut Alain De Taeye, chief executive of digital map supplier Tele Atlas, voiced doubts.\n\u201cI\u2019m incredibly enthusiastic about the opportunities. However, the last time I was incredibly enthusiastic about the opportunities, it took 20 years to realize them,\u201d De Taeye said.\nNokia is already betting on GPS-enabled phones and most top handset suppliers are expected to come out with models soon, though Flint gave no date for when Sony Ericsson would start building GPS into its phones.\nThe first selling point for GPS phones is as a tool for users to find their way around, but many believe the social networking similar to that helped by MySpace, Facebook and Flickr Web sites is what will deliver mass appeal.\nAn Amsterdam company, recently acquired by small Finnish mobile phone maker Benefon, is currently building a social networking application for GPS-enabled phones.\nThe service, branded GyPSii, will allow users to upload pictures, videos and sound clips recorded with their phones that are automatically encoded with the location where the picture was taken or the recording was made.\nUsers can see where their friends are and see and search each other\u2019s saved places.\nThe company\u2019s founders, Dan Harple and Sam Critchley, believe that eventually, these place marks will grow into a database that will deliver more relevant search results because the company also records data on who submits what and when.\nA 40-year old man searching on a Wednesday evening for a place to meet friends for drinks might get different results to a 16-year-old girl doing the same search on a Saturday night.\nSitting on board a canal boat in Amsterdam, Harple said the venture was not exactly of a scale that was likely to bring down Google.\n\u201cBut we will deliver a different type of search results. We\u2019re not just crawling the web, content is being pushed from the ground up,\u201d he said.",
        "Thanks to Meghan Markle, black pants are no surprise on a royal outing \u2014 but when Kate Middleton decided to opt for the look, we had to do a double take. On Dec. 5, the Duchess of Cambridge stepped out with Prince William at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus, wearing black wide-leg pants and the very appropriately named Smythe Duchess Blazer ($695), which she paired with a white t-shirt and an L.K.Bennett Dora clutch ($285). And this time, the casual look wasn't to play sports.\nWhile Kate often wears pants if she's participating in physical activity or visiting a center where she is expected to interact with the public, she typically goes for jeans and heels and rarely for wide-leg trousers.

        "A key provision in the 1997 accord between the county and Basketball Properties Ltd., the Heat\u2019s operating arm, stipulates that Miami-Dade is to receive 40\u2009cents of every dollar of profit after the team earns $14\u2009million in profits. Yet, 15 years into the deal \u2014 even after a 2006 world championship and nearly two years with league Most Valuable Player LeBron James \u2014 the Heat maintains it has never come close to that magic number.\nThat\u2019s because despite some profitable years, the contract allows the Heat to pay off all of its losses before declaring profitability. The team reported losses totaling $156.6 million through 2010.\nDespite James\u2019 presence, a $13 million windfall from increased ticket sales, a giant spike in food and drink concessions last year, and $72.2 million the county poured into operating the arena, the Heat remains well below the threshold of sharing profits with Miami-Dade.\n\u201cThe county has little idea of the underlying conditions and financial issues that, to date, have resulted in the Arena\u2019s failure to generate sufficient reportable net cash flow that would have allowed the county to share in the distribution of Arena excess cash flow,\u201d the audit stated.\nThe county administration, in a statement Thursday afternoon, said it is improving managerial oversight of the arena agreement.\nGimenez said his office is consulting with the county attorney and will issue a status report within 90 days as requested by the inspector general.\nMazzella said the county must familiarize itself with the Heat\u2019s complex finances and review the team\u2019s capital budgets, including how much the Heat spends on equipment leases such as those for LED screens and monitors. The county, as the owner of the arena, should also be notified of lawsuits filed against the Heat.\nThe inspector general suggested the county learn how the team makes money from lucrative concessions and \u201cpremium\u201d ticket sales, including suites. Also, the county should know more about non-basketball events at the arena, since those revenues impact potential profits, he wrote.\nMazzella also criticized the Heat, questioning $3.3\u2009million the team spent on capital improvements. He said that money should have gone toward negating losses instead.\nAnd Mazzella questioned certain Heat expenditures, including $12,300 spent on political contributions and $614,000 on lobbyists. The Heat said $10,000 went to a National Conference of Mayors convention in Miami, presided over by former Miami Mayor Manny Diaz.\nLopez, the Heat\u2019s lobbyist who earned a large chunk of the $614,000 in question, called all of the team\u2019s expenses \u201clegitimate\u201d and said the Heat will work harder to get its budgets to the county on time.\nEric Woolworth, president of the Heat Group\u2019s business operations, said in a statement that the audit failed to recognize the successes of the partnership between the Heat and the county \u2014 especially the revitalization of downtown Miami \u2014 and that it gave \u201cshort shrift on the risk\u201d the company took in undertaking construction.\nWoolworth also said Mazzella misinterpreted provisions of the agreement relating to capital expenditures and business expenses.\nThe Heat played its first game at the AAA in 2000, after a dozen years at the old Miami Arena in Overtown. Blessed with fan and corporate support, the team pined for the millions in new revenue anticipated from the sales of expensive suites, exclusive seats and high-end retail at the new arena.\nBroward County offered a better financial deal for the team to play at the BankAtlantic Center, but Heat owner Micky Arison wanted his team to remain in Miami-Dade, where he has a home.\nIn the end, Arison put $210 million toward construction, with the county spending $37.6 million to purchase the 17 waterfront acres along Biscayne Boulevard from the city of Miami. The county also paid a $5\u2009million subsidy before the arena opened and agreed to give the team $6.4 million a year for operations.",
        "The Transformative Fund Account formed 18 months ago at the Central Bank of Kenya to hold proceeds from the voluntary pay cuts has only Sh35.2 million.\nSuper salary-scale civil servants are ceding only Sh2 million per month to the Treasury, thwarting President Uhuru Kenyatta\u2019s effort to cut the ballooning public wage bill through voluntary pay cuts.\nTreasury secretary Henry Rotich said Transformative Fund Account formed 18 months ago at the Central Bank of Kenya to hold proceeds from the voluntary pay cuts has only Sh35.2 million.\nThe account also holds savings from foreign travel restrictions, hotel accommodation and other non-core expenditures.\nMr Kenyatta and his deputy, William Ruto \u2014 who are entitled to Sh1.7 million and Sh1.49 million per month respectively \u2014 pledged in March last year to take a 20 per cent pay cut as part of broader efforts to free up cash for investment in capital projects.\nThe President also directed Cabinet secretaries, PSs and heads of government departments and agencies to follow suit and take pay cut of between 20 and five per cent to reduce the wage bill adding those who defied the order would be sacked.\nLater, the 18 Cabinet secretaries and 26 PSs also pledged to voluntarily reduce their salaries by 10 per cent. Last week, Mr Rotich said Sh5.2 million had been added into the account since July.\nPublic servants earn an average of Sh47 billion a month or Sh568 billion annually.\nMr Rotich will in the meantime form a team to oversee the spending of the amount accumulated so far as Transformative Fund on development projects.\n\u201cWe will constitute a team to advise or propose transformative projects as the fund builds up,\u201d he told the Business Daily.\nFailure by civil servants to embrace voluntary pay cut points to the herculean task that awaits Budalang\u2019i MP Ababu Namwamba in his latest bid come up with a legislation chopping salaries of senior public officers by 50 per cent.\nApart from the top government officials in Mr Uhuru\u2019s scheme, Mr Namwamba is targeting the Judicial Service Commission and Parliamentary Service Commission staff. A number of politicians, including national assembly speaker Justin Muturi, have dismissed the plan as populist.\nPresident Kenyatta had, on the other hand, counted on the goodwill of the senior staff of his administration to rein in public wage.\nCabinet secretaries, who earn Sh1.12 million, would each surrender Sh112, 000 per month to Treasury and PSs Sh91,000 each from their Sh910,000 pay.\nThis means that the account should be holding more than Sh70 million from deductions made on the pay of Cabinet and principal secretaries alone over the 18 months.\nThe public service also has more than 200 chief executives of State- owned firms.\nThe Salaries and Remuneration Commission (SRC) had raised the red flag over the Sh568 billion wage bill, saying it is unsustainable.\nThe public wage bill takes up 52 per cent of government revenues, higher than the global average of 35 per cent for nations in the lower middle-income category, where Kenya belongs.\nState officers have to first write to the SRC, led by Sarah Serem, declaring that they are giving up a share of their pay.",

        "I\u2019m not one to adhere rigidly to the idea of drinking seasonally: reds when it\u2019s cold, whites and ros\u00e9s when the weather heats up. This is textbook nonsense that makes it seem as if temperature is the only consideration in choosing a wine.\nBut this is winter, a time to hunker down. For many, that means seeking pleasure in long, slow cooking.\nIn Manhattan, where I live, the idea of a hearth may be fanciful, but the warmth of the oven or stove, with a bubbling pot of beans or a simmering stew, serves the crucial figurative function.\nThe sorts of deep, soulful flavors that come from blends of herbs and spices, long braises, and meats and birds roasted on the bone require specific sorts of wines. Most often they are reds, but not just any sort of red. These foods demand staying power and the ability to stand up to robust flavors.\nYet they must also fulfill the fundamental roles of providing refreshment and enhancing meals without overpowering them. This means wines that are balanced and energetic, substantial rather than ethereal, yet not blusterous or domineering.\nHere are 20 red wines that meet those requirements, not ranked in any particular order. All are in that $15-to-$20 sweet spot where price intersects with quality and distinctiveness to yield great value. You can certainly find plenty of sound wines for less than $15, but chances are they will not be as interesting.\nFor more than $20, you can start to add in wines that may fit the bill from more highly regarded regions, like the northern Rh\u00f4ne, Priorat, even Burgundy, though pretty soon you could be spending a lot of money.\nStaying in the $15-to-$20 range requires searching outside the status areas, and trying wines that often come from little-known regions, are made from grapes that are not celebrated, and are frequently in limited production. If the wines are more familiar, like California cabernet sauvignon or Oregon pinot noir, they will often be made from young vines, or come from surplus grapes that were sold off.\nWhat you won\u2019t find here are fabricated, artificial products made with technological shortcuts or grapes that come from inappropriate areas, which permit production of cheap bottles in great quantities.\nThis means that most people will be able to find only some of these wines. As always, ask for other recommendations at the best wine shop nearby.\nThe Shebang series, moderately priced wines from Morgan Twain-Peterson\u2019s excellent Bedrock Wine Company, offers modern versions of California field blends. This spicy, gutsy wine comes from multiple vineyards and appellations, includes many grapes (with probably a lot of zinfandel and carignan), and mixes several vintages. The result is a delicious, long-lasting red with flavors of licorice, herbs and red and black fruits.\nCamp\u2019s group of moderately priced Sonoma wines comes from Kenny Likitprakong\u2019s Hobo Wine Company, which makes very good wines from all over California under several labels. This young cabernet is bright and well balanced, with a touch of earth and tannins that simply let you know they are there. It\u2019s easy to enjoy right now, especially with juicy braised meats.\nGood, moderately priced pinot noir from California is tough to find, because most of it comes from areas not well suited to the grape. Searching for well-priced pinot noirs is far more rewarding in Oregon, where land and labor costs have not accelerated out of control. This one from Les Brebis, a small producer in the Willamette Valley, is direct and without the sort of artifice often found in inexpensive pinot noirs. Its earthy flavors of red and black fruits and herbs pair well with pork, chicken and salmon.\nWhy, here\u2019s another one, also from the Willamette, and quite different in style from the Brebis. It\u2019s made from organic and biodynamically grown grapes, and is equally elegant in profile. It\u2019s a little more floral and herbal, and it has a meatier character, with a deliciously savory edge. Try it with hearty soups.\nYet another side of cabernet franc, this one comes from W\u00f6lffer Estate on the South Fork of Long Island. It\u2019s rich and expressive, more in the Bordeaux style than the Loire, less subtle, more open and welcoming. It\u2019s balanced and earthy, and though the tannins are still a bit firm, it will go well with a meaty stew.\nLike W\u00f6lffer Estate, Channing Daughters is based on the South Fork of Long Island, yet the estates could not be more different. W\u00f6lffer takes a more classical approach, but Channing is joyfully experimental, growing an eclectic range of grapes not otherwise seen on Long Island. The \u201915 Rosso Fresco incorporates some of these \u2014 blaufr\u00e4nkisch and dornfelder along with merlot, syrah and cabernet franc. It\u2019s bright, vividly fruity and floral, and absolutely delicious.\nSan Diego? Seriously? While the San Diego coast is more readily associated with beach volleyball and Navy bases, San Diego County is also home to a small wine region with some surprisingly good producers. Vesper Vineyards makes this fruity, smoky, well-balanced carignan tempered by citrus highlights.\nFoxglove is the reliable value arm of Varner Wine, which makes fine chardonnays and pinot noirs. Foxglove expands that range with moderately priced wines like this Paso Robles cabernet, which is bold and intense yet not at all a fruit bomb. It\u2019s juicy and balanced, and will go well with steaks and chops.\nAn earlier version of this article misstated the name of the importer of Fattoria La Rivolta Aglianico del Taburno. It is T.

        "A neutrino event, identifiable by the rings of Cerenkov radiation that show up along the photomultiplier tubes lining the detector walls, showcase the successful methodology of neutrino astronomy. This image shows multiple events.\nSometimes, the best-designed experiments fail. The effect you're looking for might not even occur, meaning that a null result should always be a possible outcome you're prepared for. When that happens, the experiment is often dismissed as a failure, even though you never would have known the results without performing it.\nYet, every once in a while, the apparatus that you build might be sensitive to something else entirely. When you do science in a new way, at a new sensitivity, or under new, unique conditions, that's often where the most surprising, serendipitous discoveries are made. In 1987, a failed experiment for detecting proton decay detected neutrinos, for the first time, from beyond not only our Solar System, but from outside of the Milky Way. This is how neutrino astronomy was born.\nThe conversion of a neutron to a proton, an electron, and an anti-electron neutrino is how Pauli hypothesized resolving the energy non-conservation problem in beta decay.\nAlpha decay, where a larger atom emits a helium nucleus, jumping two elements down the periodic table.\nBeta decay, where an atomic nucleus emits a high-energy electron, moving one element up the periodic table.\nGamma decay, where an atomic nucleus emits an energetic photon, remaining in the same location on the periodic table.\nIn any reaction, under the laws of physics, whatever the total energy and momentum of the initial reactants are, the energy and momentum of the final products need to match. For alpha and gamma decays, they always did. But for beta decays? Never. Energy was always lost.\nThe V-shaped track in the center of the image is likely a muon decaying to an electron and two neutrinos. The high-energy track with a kink in it is evidence of a mid-air particle decay. This decay, if the (undetected) neutrino is not included, would violate energy conservation.\nIn 1930, Wolfgang Pauli proposed a new particle that could solve the problem: the neutrino. This small, neutral particle could carry both energy and momentum, but would be extremely difficult to detect. It wouldn't absorb or emit light, and would only interact with atomic nuclei extremely rarely.\nUpon its proposal, rather than confident and elated, Pauli felt ashamed. \"I have done a terrible thing, I have postulated a particle that cannot be detected,\" he declared. But despite his reservations, the theory was vindicated by experiment.\nReactor nuclear experimental RA-6 (Republica Argentina 6), en marcha, showing the characteristic Cherenkov radiation from the faster-than-light-in-water particles emitted. The neutrinos (or more accurately, antineutrinos) first hypothesized by Pauli in 1930 were detected from a similar nuclear reactor in 1956.\nor they cause the emission of new particles, which have their own energies and momenta.\nEither way, you can build specialized particle detectors around where you expect the neutrinos to interact, and look for them. This was how the first neutrinos were detected: by building particle detectors sensitive to neutrino signatures at the edges of nuclear reactors. If you reconstructed the entire energy of the products, including neutrinos, energy is conserved after all.\nSchematic illustration of nuclear beta decay in a massive atomic nucleus. Only if the (missing) neutrino energy and momentum is included can these quantities be conserved.\nIn theory, neutrinos should be produced wherever nuclear reactions take place: in the Sun, in stars and supernovae, and whenever an incoming high-energy cosmic ray strikes a particle from Earth's atmosphere. By the 1960s, physicists were building neutrino detectors to look for both solar (from the Sun) and atmospheric (from cosmic ray) neutrinos.\nA large amount of material, with mass designed to interact with the neutrinos inside of it, would be surrounded by this neutrino detection technology. In order to shield the neutrino detectors from other particles, they were placed far underground: in mines. Only neutrinos should make it into the mines; the other particles should be absorbed by the Earth. By the end of the 1960s, solar and atmospheric neutrinos had both successfully been found.\nThe particle detection technology that was developed for both neutrino experiments and high-energy accelerators was found to be applicable to another phenomenon: the search for proton decay. While the Standard Model of particle physics predicts that the proton is absolutely stable, in many extensions \u2014 such as Grand Unification Theories \u2014 the proton can decay into lighter particles.\nIn theory, whenever a proton does decay, it will emit lower-mass particles at very high speeds. If you can detect the energies and momenta of those fast-moving particles, you can reconstruct what the total energy is, and see if it came from a proton.\nHigh-energy particles can collide with others, producing showers of new particles that can be seen in a detector. By reconstructing the energy, momentum, and other properties of each one, we can determine what initially collided and what was produced in this event.\nIf protons decay, their lifetime must be extremely long. The Universe itself is 1010 years old, but the proton's lifetime must be much longer. How much longer? The key is to look not at one proton, but at an enormous number. If a proton's lifetime is 1030 years, you can either take a single proton and wait that long (a bad idea), or take 1030 protons and wait 1 year to see if any decay.\nA liter of water contains a little over 1025 molecules in it, where each molecule contains two hydrogen atoms: a proton orbited by an electron. If the proton is unstable, a large enough tank of water, with a large set of detectors around it, should allow you to either measure or constrain its stability/instability.\nA schematic layout of the KamiokaNDE apparatus from the 1980s. For scale, the tank is approximately 15 meters (50 feet) tall.\nIn Japan, in 1982, they began constructing a large underground detector in the Kamioka mines. The detector was named KamiokaNDE: Kamioka Nucleon Decay Experiment. It was large enough to hold over 3,000 tons of water, with around a thousand detectors optimized to detect the radiation that fast-moving particles would emit.\nBy 1987, the detector had been running for years, without a single instance of proton decay. With around 1033 protons in that tank, this null result completely eliminated the most popular model among Grand Unified Theories. The proton, as far as we could tell, doesn't decay. KamiokaNDE's main objective was a failure.\nA supernova explosion enriches the surrounding interstellar medium with heavy elements. The outer rings are caused by previous ejecta, long before the final explosion. This explosion also emitted a huge variety of neutrinos, some of which made it all the way to Earth.\nBut then something unexpected happened. 165,000 years earlier, in a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, a massive star reached the end of its life and exploded in a supernova. On February 23, 1987, that light reached Earth for the first time.\nBut a few hours before that light arrived, something remarkable happened at KamiokaNDE: a total of 12 neutrinos arrived within a span of about 13 seconds. Two bursts \u2014 the first containing 9 neutrinos and the second containing 3 \u2014 demonstrated that the nuclear processes that create neutrinos occur in great abundance in supernovae.\nThree different detectors observed the neutrinos from SN 1987A, with KamiokaNDE the most robust and successful. The transformation from a nucleon decay experiment to a neutrino detector experiment would pave the way for the developing science of neutrino astronomy.\nand that neutrinos aren't slowed down as they travel from the core of the collapsing star to its photospher, the way that light is.\nEven today, more than 30 years later, we can examine this supernova remnant and see how it's evolved.\nThe outward-moving shockwave of material from the 1987 explosion continues to collide with previous ejecta from the formerly massive star, heating and illuminating the material when collisions occur. A wide variety of observatories continue to image the supernova remnant today.\nThe scientific importance of this result cannot be overstated. It marked the birth of neutrino astronomy, just as the first direct detection of gravitational waves from merging black holes marked the birth of gravitational wave astronomy. It was the birth of multi-messenger astronomy, marking the first time that the same object had been observed in both electromagnetic radiation (light) and via another method (neutrinos).\nIt showed us the potential of using large, underground tanks to detect cosmic events. And it causes us to hope that, someday, we might make the ultimate observation: an event where light, neutrinos, and gravitational waves all come together to teach us all about the workings of the objects in our Universe.\nThe ultimate event for multi-messenger astronomy would be a merger of either two white dwarfs or two neutrons stars that was close enough. If such an event occurred in near-enough proximity to Earth, neutrinos, light, and gravitational waves could all be detected.\nMost cleverly, it resulted in a renaming of KamiokaNDE. The Kamioka Nucleon Decay Experiment was a total failure, so KamiokaNDE was out. But the spectacular observation of neutrinos from SN 1987A gave rise to a new observatory: KamiokaNDE, the Kamioka Neutrino Detector Experiment! Over the past 30+ years, this has now been upgraded many times, and multiple similar facilities have popped up all over the world.\nIf a supernova were to go off today, in our own galaxy, we would be treated to upwards of 10,000 neutrinos arriving in our detector. All of them, combined, have further constrained the lifetime of the proton to now be greater than around 1035 years, but that's not why we build them. Whenever a high-energy cataclysm occurs, neutrinos speed through the Universe. With our detectors online, neutrino astronomy is alive, well, and ready for whatever the cosmos sends our way.",

He also told The Globe that hopes for a successful treaty in December seemed to be fading.\nCanada has proposed to cut its emissions by 20 percent from 2006 levels by 2020 \u2013 a modest target compared to European goals. In previous iterations of its climate policy, released during the Bush administration, the Canadian government pushed for emission intensity targets for a broad range of industries, including oil sands producers, rather than sectoral emission caps.\nEarlier this month, Mr. Jacobson, a close acquaintance of President Obama, toured the oil sands. \u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot about the tremendous strides that have been taken over the last several years with respect to improving the environmental record in treating the oil sands,\u201d he told Reuters.\nBut at the other end of the diplomatic relationship, Canada\u2019s new ambassador to Washington, Gary Doer, told The Calgary Herald last week that the oil sands get a \u201cdisproportionate\u201d amount of criticism.",

        "Following in her mother\u2019s footsteps, 23-year-old Shakisa Olinda Harvey is among the newest admissions to the bar after graduating last Saturday from the Hugh Wooding Law School as an Attorney-at-Law.\nThe bubbly Harvey is the daughter of recently-appointed High Court Judge Justice Simone Morris-Ramlall.\nAlways certain of the career path she wanted to pursue, Harvey, who was called to the bar on Monday, said she has proven that determination, hard work and dedication truly pays off.\nPresenting her petition before Madame Chief Justice (ag) Roxane George, attorney Abiola Wong-Inniss, to whose chambers Harvey is attached as an associate, described her as industrious.\nRecalling Harvey\u2019s in-service stints spent at her chambers during her vacations home from law school, Wong-Inniss said her performance was always exemplary.\nThe lawyer said that she was honoured not only to have been presenting Harvey\u2019s petition, but more importantly to have her within the employ of her chambers, where her knowledge and expertise will make her an asset.\nIn her charge, the Chief Justice reminded the young attorney that she has \u201chuman precedents\u201d to follow and admonished her to strive always for excellence. \u201cNever settle for mediocrity,\u201d the Chief Justice warned.\nHarvey was encouraged to \u201cbe a lawyer\u2019s, lawyer,\u201d and to truly advocate for her clients, providing to them the best counsel always. Justice George cautioned that the sleepless nights will continue, and that the word \u201cresearch\u201d must always be her mantra.\nLooking intently at the Chief Justice as she counseled her, the new lawyer heard that \u201cservice\u201d to others and being a voice for the voiceless will be key to upholding the rule of law.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not aiming to be any lawyer or some lawyer, you are aiming for excellence,\u201d Justice George said, \u201cBe a leader\u2026 Aim to be famous and not infamous,\u201d she added.\nA former student of the Bishops\u2019 High School like Harvey, Justice George said it is always an honour to admit students of her alma mater to the legal profession. She, however, noted that in Harvey\u2019s case it was particularly memorable as it is the same date that she herself was admitted to the bar.\nIn her speech thanking the court for accepting her petition, Harvey, who became emotional and was moved to tears, also expressed gratitude for her mother\u2019s unwavering support throughout her studies.\nFrom a lengthy list which she said was by no means exhaustive, the young woman said she owes a debt of gratitude to everyone who played a part in her attaining her dream and noted that she shares her achievement with them all.\nRecalling her stint as a reporter with the Stabroek News some years ago, Harvey said she was grateful for the opportunity of exposure to the courtroom, which she noted will no doubt be an asset for her career.\nHarvey\u2019s call to the Bar was witnessed by loved ones, friends and other well-wishers.\nAfter attending the Bishops\u2019 High School from 2010 to 2012, where she completed Sixth Form studies, Harvey moved on to the University of Guyana, where she read for, and attained her Bachelor of Law Degree in 2015. Thereafter, she attended the Trinidad-based Hugh Wooding Law School, where she was awarded her Legal Education Certificate (LEC).",

        "Fans, coaches and players -- not just officials -- need to step up their games before disaster strikes.\nIf you follow me on social media (the math involving my modest number of followers says it\u2019s unlikely) you know I\u2019ve been consistent in my bewilderment at the officiating of area high school football games this season.\nOfficiating has affected, and perhaps determined, the outcome of several games. My beef hasn\u2019t simply been about judgment calls that appeared to be judged incorrectly (those happen), but rather with the mechanics.\nCrews have often bumbled yardage mark offs, spots (the ball can\u2019t be exactly on the yard line EVERY time \u2013 that\u2019s lazy), downs and rules. The common occurrences expose inexperienced, perhaps undertrained officials.\nHowever, there are reasons for the above. Who in the heck would want to be an official today? One hundred bucks a game isn\u2019t terrible, but do you want to be the subject of nonstop verbal abuse for three hours?\nShreveport football officiating 101: Why take the abuse?\nThe officiating hasn't been the only embarrassing factor in games I\u2019ve attended, or received reports from. I\u2019m not sure if some coaches spent more time calling plays and schemes or crawling in the ear holes of the folks in stripes.\nThe actions in the stands isn\u2019t any better. If the right team wins or executes a terrific play, fans are happy. If not, it\u2019s the officials\u2019 fault. The mind-set is completely out of control.\nI covered the North Webster-Loyola game last week and witnessed the cops called to the field twice. One instance involved a disruptive member of the chain gang, the second sent a handful of officers to track down an unruly, profanity-loving fan.\nYoung athletes aren\u2019t winning in life if parents and coaches conjure excuses to blame everyone else for a lack of execution or the fact another team/player is simply better. Winning is terrific; I\u2019m as competitive as they come. However, losing can teach us all just as much, and, in the long run, produce victories.\nI\u2019ve never heard of a college coach or NFL scout pass on a kid because the referee made a bad call. If your kid is good enough, he or she will get there. And it\u2019s better off if they\u2019re tough and able to self-evaluate. If they look the other way and point fingers amid adversity, good luck, the road will be much bumpier.\nIt\u2019s not good for anyone to look into the stands and see parents literally fighting (not at the Week 10 game I attended), or throwing food on the field because of a perceived bad call. It\u2019s also not good to see officials (barely) escape a mob of hysterical fans \u2013 despite the help of policemen -- at a local game.\nOne local coach called the referee at the center of the Loyola-North Webster game \u201cthe one guy I\u2019d choose to referee my games.\u201d The point: Officials, like your favorite team, can struggle. They\u2019re human. But they didn\u2019t put your boys in a three-touchdown hole.\nAmazingly, fans don\u2019t credit officials after victories. How is that possible?\nI'm more incensed by the aftermath of such incidents like the ones I witnessed at Loyola. Adult rarely (at best) take responsibility for their \u2013 or fellow fans\u2019 \u2013 actions. A bad call doesn\u2019t give the rest of us carte blanche. Imagine if everyone around you lost their marbles and you became a bull's-eye for vitriol after you dub a coach\u2019s decision \u201cidiotic\u201d moments before it works and you\u2019re on your feet cheering.\nNo one gets it all right.\nAs Friday\u2019s game developed, some of the Loyola players popped off in frustration, and that\u2019s not to be excused, but they, along with Loyola coaches, were ultimately forced to turn from the field of play and tell their fan base to cool it as things got heated at Messmer Stadium.\nThe kids had to tell the parents to act like adults.\nBy no stretch are the officials or fans present at the Loyola game the only problem. I\u2019ve seen it \u2013 on and off the field -- all season. However, it was Week 10. We\u2019re now in the postseason. If we don\u2019t compose ourselves, playoff implications could take rage to another level and that\u2019s when national headlines \u2013 not good ones -- could be made.\n\u201cJohnny\u201d doesn\u2019t want to carry the burden of watching his parents punching (or worse) a fan or official on YouTube for the rest of his life.\nBoo the officials or opposing fans all you want, it\u2019s tradition. However, verbal and physical abuse is sometimes illegal and always completely embarrassing. The actions, the threats toward officials are getting worse.\nI know social media, and the current climate, has made it OK to call each other names, disrespect one another and demean opinions without merit, but for crying out loud think about your actions when you\u2019re in public. At least spam-like usernames and accounts can help hide your identity on social media.\nBut Friday nights are real life. With real-life implications. Coach the games, watch the games, officiate the games. Stop deflecting blame and embrace the teachable moments in wins and losses. And more importantly, remember those are fellow human beings who drop passes, miss blocks and butcher pass interference calls.\nWe can all be better. We must be better.",

When you're here, you're right smack in the middle of it.\nThe Brew Stooges, a craft beer venture started by business partners Bramon, Tracy Mullins and Jeff Peck, launched a new tasting room and outdoor seating area a few months ago at its facility on 109 Maple Ave.\nWith help from volunteers and groups like Know Huntsville, Mullins, Peck and Bramon have seen their customer base grow in recent months with the addition of free barbecue on Saturday nights, music events and even a live podcast.\n\"It's doing a lot better than we originally envisioned to start off with,\" Bramon said. \"And it just keeps getting bigger and bigger.\"\nDown the street from the iconic, now-closed Tip Top Caf\u00e9, the beer makers are working on new signage to attract more brew lovers to the downtown brewery and tap room, which seats up to 25.\nAlthough there are a couple of picnic tables out back, Bramon said the crowds have been so large they \"routinely have people standing.\"\nThe Brew Stooges isn't the only local craft beer business seeing hefty growth.

The number of taxable removal barrels (the amount of beer sold and taxed) was 28,373 in 2013, up 47 percent from 2012, while the number of breweries nearly doubled from seven in 2012 to 13 in 2013.\nYou can now find The Brew Stooges' local brews at Huntsville's Bandito Burrito, West End Grill, The Nook, Mellow Mushroom and Pie in the Sky. Their beer is also on tap in Decatur, Athens, Birmingham, Mobile, Montgomery and Tuscaloosa.\nPeck, who spends his work days at NASA, feels good about their progress.\n\"We want to try to grow the business organically with the market,\" he said. \"If the market doesn't grow, then we don't get any bigger ... but I think it will. We think we can grow our market into Alabama, as well as at some point go across state lines.\"\nThe brewhouse is located in a building where Mullins ran his side business, Complete Plumbing, for about 10 years. The trio started construction on the property in the spring of 2012 before opening a year later.\nDuring the first 10 months of operation, Peck said they were busy getting their processes down, reaching distribution agreements and landing new markets. When they felt comfortable enough to move forward with the expansion, they assembled the tap room.\nThe brewhouse is open to the public from 5 to 9 p.m. Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. Bramon said they're working with the city of Huntsville to bring a trolley to the downtown brewery.\n\"If we can get folks to ride the trolley down here, that means we'll be on the normal downtown circuit,\" he said. \"You can come downtown and visit us anytime you want and you don't have to drive.\"\nA beer tasting with The Brew Stooges will take place July 12 and 26 during The Lowry House's Backyard Concert Series.",

        "Martin Scorsese and Robert Di Niro will collaborate for the first time in decades.\nMartin Scorsese's \"Silence\" may have been his 28-year-old passion project, but it was mostly ignored by audiences, grossing only $7 million in the U.S. opposite a $40 million budget. Something tells us the same fate won't meet the director's next project, which carries an even bigger budget and bigger stars.\nJack Nicholson and Leonardo DiCaprio in \"The Departed\"\nScorsese has built his career on iconic gangster movies, from \"Goodfellas\" to \"Casino,\" \"Mean Streets\" and \"The Departed,\" so his return to the genre after more than a decade is cause for celebration.\n\"The Irishman\" is based on the 2003 book \"I Heard You Paint Houses\" by Charles Brandt, which recounts the years Frank \"The Irishman\" Sheeran spent as a mob hitman. Brandt interviewed Sheeran over a five-year period, during which the mobster confessed to being involved in more than 25 hits for the mob. Sheeran was allegedly involved in the death of legendary mob boss Jimmy Hoffa, who went missing in July 1975 and was never found.\nAnyone hoping for Scorsese to capture the cinematic energy of \"Goodfellas\" once again may want to lower their expectations. It appears the filmmaker is going to be making a much more elegiac and sobering gangster movie this time around. \"The Irishman\" picks up with Sheeran as an older man as he looks back on the hits that defined his mob career.\n\"The people are also older in 'The Irishman,' it's certainly more about looking back, a retrospective so to speak of a man's life and the choices that he's had to make,\" Scorsese told The Independent in May.\nAs to whether the movie follows in the tradition of \"Goodfellas\"? He told the outlet, \"I think this is different, I think it is. I admit that there are - you know, 'Goodfellas' and 'Casino' have a certain style that I created for them - it's on the page in the script actually\u2026The style of the picture, the cuts, the freeze-frames, all of this was planned way in advance, but here it's a little different.\"\nRobert De Niro in \"Casino\"\nScorsese and Robert De Niro's careers are intertwined after making eight movies together, including \"Taxi Driver,\" \"Raging Bull\" and \"The King of Comedy.\" But the duo haven't made a movie together since \"Casino,\" which was released 22 years ago in November 1995. \"The Irishman\" will mark their ninth collaboration.\nWhile Scorsese's career in the two decades since has remained strong, De Niro hasn't really had a critically acclaimed lead dramatic role in several years. He earned a Best Supporting Actor nomination for \"Silver Linings Playbook,\" but reuniting with Scorsese is just what his big screen career needs most right now.\nJoe Pesci, Ray Liotta and Robert De Niro in \"Goodfellas\"\nThe supporting cast for \"The Irishman\" is truly an embarrassment of riches: Al Pacino, Harvey Keitel, Ray Romano and Bobby Cannavale. But arguably the most anticipated bit of casting is Joe Pesci, who has only had two credits to his name this century: A cameo in De Niro's 2006 CIA drama \"The Good Shepherd\" and a lead role in Taylor Hackford's 2010 flop \"Love Ranch.\" Prior to 2006, Pesci hadn't starred in a single movie since 1998's \"Lethal Weapon 4.\" The semi-retired actor is officially coming back to the big screen for a \"Goodfellas\" reunion with Scorsese and De Niro.\nPesci had been rumored to be joining \"The Irishman,\" but his casting wasn't confirmed until earlier this month. He's reportedly playing Russell Bufalino, a Mafia boss operating out of Pennsylvania who has long been suspected of having a hand in Hoffa's disappearance. The character means we'll most likely be seeing Pesci and De Niro in scenes opposite one another.\nScorsese and Pesci have made three movies together. Pesci won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his turn in \"Goodfellas.\"\n\"The Irishman\" will follow in the footsteps of \"Hugo\" as a Scorsese movie that depends heavily on visual effects. The director is teaming with George Lucas' VFX company Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) to utilize the same effects used on Brad Pitt in \"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\" so that De Niro can be digitally aged to look younger in the flashback scenes.\n\"The Irishman\" will include flashbacks that span decades, and De Niro is set to play Sheeran in all of them. He'll appear as young as 30 years old.\nThe visual effects required for \"The Irishman\" are part of the reason the film's budget is over the $100 million mark. That's a massive price tag for any filmmaker, and it's why Scorsese has taken up shop at Netflix to make the movie despite his love of the theatrical experience over streaming.\n\"The Irishman\" has been in development since 2008 and was originally going to be backed by Paramount Pictures, but the studio couldn't afford to take on such a risky budget. International rights were purchased by STX Entertainment for $50 million at Cannes 2016, but they backed down after Netflix took over for Paramount and bought worldwide streaming rights.\n\"The Irishman\" is officially shooting in New York City this summer, with a production start date set for the middle of August. Principal photography is scheduled until December. The five-month shoot will just a bit longer than the filming of \"Silence,\" which took place in Taiwan from January 30 to May 15, 2015. But it's nothing compared to \"Gangs of New York\" shoot. That massive production lasted for nearly eight months (August 2000 - April 2001).\nMatin Scorsese and Andrew Garfield on the set of \"Silence\"\nA lot of attention surrounding \"The Irishman\" is being paid to the people appearing in front of the camera, but just as exciting are the collaborators joining Scorsese behind it. Most notable is cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto, who has become a favorite of Scorsese's in recent years after shooting both \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" and \"Silence.\" The latter earned him his second Oscar nomination for Best Cinematography. His first was for \"Brokeback Mountain\" in 2005. Prieto first earned attention for his work with Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu (\"Amores perros,\" \"21 Grams\" and \"Babel\").\nScreenwriter Steve Zallian, meanwhile, adapted the book for the big screen. Zallian, who just earned an Emmy nomination for directing his HBO limited series \"The Night Of,\" wrote the script for Scorsese's \"Gangs of New York\" and earned an Oscar nomination. He won Best Adapted Screenplay for \"Schindler's List\" in 1993.\nScorsese's longtime editor Thelma Schoonmaker will also return for \"The Irishman.\" She was the editor on the director's 1967 feature debut, \"Who's That Knocking at My Door,\" and has edited all of his films since \"Raging Bull\" in 1980. Her work with Scorsese has resulted in six Oscar nominations for Best Editing and three wins (\"Raging Bull,\" \"The Aviator\" and \"The Departed\").\nAnd now for the bad news: \"The Irishman\" won't be released until 2019. At the very earliest we could get an Oscar-qualifying run in select theaters in late December 2018, but reports say Netflix is eyeing a day-and-date rollout in 2019. Because of the extensive VFX work required, it makes sense the movie won't open for a year after the cameras stop rolling. Let the long wait for \"The Irishman\" begin.",

        "Granite Geek: When is a drought not a drought?\nRight now in Concord, we are living in a meteorological puzzle: The National Weather Service says this is the wettest August since records began being kept 150 years ago, yet the National Weather Service also says the region is \u201cabnormally dry,\u201d the first stage of its drought-measurement scale.\nNo, climate change hasn\u2019t driven weather folks crazy. The solution to the puzzle is that there are droughts and then there are droughts.\n\u201cThere is a time lapse in how different systems respond to current conditions,\u201d is how Richard Kiah, chief of Hydrologic Network Operations for the regional office of the U.S. Geological Survey, puts it.\nIn laymen\u2019s terms: When wet weather appears, as it did in July, after a long stretch of very dry weather like we had this spring, the grass starts growing pretty quickly but it takes longer to fill up the aquifers that our wells depend on. A drought above ground might end, might even give way to flooding, while drought lingers below ground.\nThat\u2019s roughly what we\u2019re seeing now, although thankfully the drought and flooding have been minor compared to other parts of the country.\nAs of Saturday, the official rainfall total in Concord for the month of August is 9.36 inches, breaking the all-time August record of 9 inches, set in 1892. Even so, Concord and the swath of central New Hampshire from Sullivan County to Carroll County are officially \u201cabnormally dry,\u201d the first of five categories on the federal drought-measurement scale.\nThis discrepancy is a function of the \u201ctime lapse\u201d that Kiah mentioned above. As an illustration, he pointed to the town of Warner.\nUSGS maintains a series of measuring devices around the state that keep track of groundwater levels, meaning how much water is available for wells, and other devices that measure how much is flowing on the surface in rivers. Warner has a stream gauge measuring flow on the Warner River, and also a groundwater well nearby.\nAt the end of March, which is roughly when the dry spell began, the stream gauge in Warner was measuring water flow above the 95th percentile point for that time of year, meaning more water was flowing in the river than almost late March in history. The groundwater level was almost that high as well: It was in the 90th percentile.\nBy mid-July, after two months of bone-dry weather, the surface stream gauge had plunged almost to the 10th percentile, meaning that nearly nine out of 10 past Julys had seen more water in the river, definitely a drought signal. Yet at the same time, groundwater gauge was still in the \u201cnormal\u201d range, just slightly under the long-term average.\nBoth gauges are now trending upwards, and I would guess that in the next few weeks central New Hampshire will be out of the drought category entirely, as they are already in southern New Hampshire. It\u2019s not straightforward, though.\nThe designation of drought requires more than just measuring recent rainfall or water flows. Other factors intrude, notably evapotranspiration, which is the measure of how much of the moisture falling from the ground and existing in the air as humidity is used by plants.\n\u201cAt this time of year, some of the rainfall is not going to be recharging the groundwater, it\u2019s going to be taken up by the plants and trees,\u201d Kiah said. So even if a wet period is good for plants, fixing the agricultural drought, it may not be all that good for long-term water supplies.\nAll this makes determining whether we\u2019re in a drought something of an art as well as a science, balancing the needs of plants and people today with the needs of plants and people in the coming weeks and months.\n\u201cNew Hampshire\u2019s drought management plan takes into account these things,\u201d Kiah said.\nThe terminology goes from meteorological drought, due to a lack of rain, to agricultural drought, when the soil dries out, to hydrological drought, affecting groundwater and stream flows. Perhaps what should happen is that we give up on the idea of announcing whether we\u2019re in a drought and instead announce whether we\u2019re in any of three possible types of drought.\nBut probably not. That would confuse people more than enlighten them.\nAfter all, designating a drought is as much a social and political marker as a scientific marker. It gives governments authority to impose watering bans and it motivates people to save water. Even if it isn\u2019t always logically consistent, it\u2019s still useful.",

        "Activist shareholders in Australia\u2019s largest independent coalminer are expected to vote in record numbers on Thursday to demand Whitehaven Coal aligns its long-term company strategy with the Paris climate agreement.\nGuardian Australia understands the group Market Forces has secured support from some superannuation funds and large overseas investors in Whitehaven for three resolutions that will be put to the company\u2019s annual general meeting in Sydney.\nWill van der Pol, a legal researcher and campaigner at Market Forces, said investors had been \u201creceptive\u201d in recent discussions.\nOne non-binding advisory resolution calls on the company to disclose climate change-related risks to shareholders, in line with recommendations of the Financial Stability Board\u2019s taskforce on climate-related financial disclosures.\nAnother proposal says that shareholders call on the board to make strategy and capital expenditure decisions \u201cconsistent with the climate goals of the Paris agreement\u201d in order to safeguard the longer-term success of the company and respond to risks and opportunities posed by climate change.\n\u201cWe move this resolution in order to ensure our company is protected from stranded asset risks, and poised to take advantage of regulatory and market changes as international action is taken to satisfy the goals established by the Paris climate change agreement,\u201d a supporting statement says.\n\u201cGiven the higher stranding risk of coal assets over oil and gas, coal producers should be acting more urgently than other fossil fuel producers.\nAny substantial level of support would be significant, considering Whitehaven is a pure-play coalminer.\nThe company released a statement to the ASX on 5 October that indicated it would consider climate risk reporting in 2019, a move interpreted as a concession to activist shareholders. It followed an Australian Securities and Investments Commission report last month critical of the level of climate risk disclosures by companies.\n\u201cWhitehaven is committed to playing a role in reducing carbon emissions ... by promoting increased use of Whitehaven\u2019s high-quality, low-emissions coal,\u201d the company said in its statement to the ASX.\nWhitehaven\u2019s future planning is based on the \u201cNew Policies Scenario\u201d of the International Energy Agency, under which coal demand to Asia would double by 2040. Under that scenario, global warming would increase to about 2.7 degrees above pre-industrial levels by 2100.\nUnder a Paris baseline scenario modelled by the IEA, international demand for thermal coal would halve by 2040.\nVan de Pol said the resolutions at Thursday\u2019s Whitehaven AGM were \u201can opportunity for investors to make their mark and say this is exactly what we expect companies to be doing\u201d.\n\u201cThese sorts of resolutions are about the long-term sustainability of these companies,\u201d he said.\nClimate activists have increasingly switched from the coalface to the boardroom in recent years, where campaigns for large investors to divest from fossil fuels have gathered pace.\nAt last week\u2019s AGM for the Queensland-based freight rail company Aurizon, investor proxies asked repeated questions about the company\u2019s role in hauling coal and its potential to support operations in the Galilee Basin.\nThe Aurizon chairman, Tim Poole, told the meeting the company\u2019s coal freight rail network had a higher risk profile than other utilities and that the company was concerned about \u201cstranded asset risk\u201d.\n\u201cAt some point in the next 50 years, renewable energy might be such that we might not be hauling as much thermal coal as we are today ... part of our system might not be required,\u201d Poole said.",

        "It's not hard to figure out what the worst part of last night's MTV Movie Awards was: The Pussycat Dolls performance of \"AGGGHH! Boom!

Students suing the college claim the program does not qualify them to be medical lab technicians.\nADVERTISING: Attorney Scott Schutzman provided this ad that he says shows Newbridge College changed its advertisement after being sued by students. Previous ads in PennySaver offer a \"medical laboratory technician\" program, while this ad offers a \"medical laboratory technician associate\" program.\nFILING SUIT: Attorney Scott Schutzman discusses a class-action lawsuit against Newbridge College with two of his clients. A group of students are alleging they were misled about school's medical lab technician program.\nCLASS ACTION: Astrid Estrada listens as Ernestine Latimer discusses her complaints against Newbridge College.\nCOMPLAINTS: Ernestine Latimer, left, and Astrid Estrada, right, discuss their grievances against Newbridge College.\nSANTA ANA \u2014 Unhappy former students have filed a class-action lawsuit against Newbridge College, alleging they were each defrauded out of $10,000 tuition by promises they could earn good salaries for medical jobs they were ineligible to obtain.\nTwelve former students say they were persuaded to enroll on the promise that they needed only training from Newbridge to get lucrative jobs as medical laboratory technicians.\nThe plaintiffs said they didn\u2019t learn until well into the eight-month program that lab technician positions paying $18-$24 an hour require an accredited associate\u2019s degree that the school does not offer.\nNewbridge\u2019s attorney, Keith Zakarin, with the Duane Morris LLP law office in San Diego, said the school makes it clear students will be eligible only for entry-level jobs after they finish their training.\n\u201cNo one was misled,\u201d Zakarin said.\nNewbridge College enrolls about 500 students on campuses in Santa Ana, Long Beach, Monterey Park and Glendale.\nThe college also reported to the federal government that it was offering a clinical/medical laboratory technician diploma during the 2007-08 academic year for $9,950 to students who completed 36 credit hours over eight months, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.\nBut to become a licensed technician, candidates must have at least an associate\u2019s degree or possess three years\u2019 on-the-job training and pass a tough exam. The jobs pay $30,000 to $47,000 a year, according to state employment figures.\nWithout the license, students would only qualify for lower-paid jobs as lab assistants, for example, who freeze specimens or prepare blood or urine samples to be tested, said Debbie Wagner of Cupertino-based DeAnza College.\nWagner runs one of only two programs approved by the California Department of Public Health to train medical laboratory technicians.\n\u201cWhy would they pay $10,000 to be trained for a job that doesn\u2019t pay any more than they earn now?\u201d said the students\u2019 lawyer, Scott Schutzman, who filed the Orange County Superior Court lawsuit in June.\nThe confusion seems to result from changes in the state law that took place in December, when the Department of Public Health began regulating medical laboratory technician jobs and giving them more authority and pay. Before December, only trained scientists with advanced degrees were allowed to perform blood counts, urinalysis, cholesterol and other laboratory tests in California.\nHowever, because of a lack of a workforce, the state began the process several years ago of changing the job descriptions to allow a newly created breed of trained and licensed medical laboratory technicians to perform those tests.\nWagner said that people in the field had been aware for years that the rules were changing and that, in fact, that\u2019s why she started DeAnza\u2019s program.\nNewbridge students said they only learned they were ineligible for the technician jobs during a field trip to a hospital laboratory, when a lab director told them she would only hire them as assistants.\nZakarin said that, prior to the change in the law, medical lab technician programs \u201cdid not need DPH approval\u201d except for the aspects that included phlebotomy certification, which involves drawing blood.\nThe job to which he\u2019s referring, though, is that of a lab associate \u2013 essentially an assistant, not a technician who actually performs the tests.\n\u201cAfter the change in the law, the specific MLT job outcome required an associate\u2019s (degree) and because NC\u2019s program is a diploma program; it was not eligible for DPH approval of the entire program,\u201d Zakarin said.\nRegister news researcher Michael Doss contributed to this report.",

        "Q: My great uncle, born in 1874 was the keeper of this bottle which he kept in a curio cabinet in my childhood. It might have belonged to another relative who worked in the china department of Woolworths from 1910-1930. Is it possible that such an item would be sold at Woolworths? My uncle also inherited items from a friend who was a scholar at the University of Leipzig circa 1898. My wife and I would be interested in learning anything you can tell us about this attractive object.\nA: Your attractive figural fish scent bottle is very rare. It is hand-blown green cased glass which has an inner white layer, a middle vibrant green layer and an outer clear layer harboring the applied gilt enamel. The tail is shaped and molded when the glass is molten with a hand tool. The eye is an applied red cabochon set in white enamel. The sterling silver cap was made by the firm of George Edwin Walton & Co. Ltd. in 1881-82 at Hylton Street, Birmingham. It harbors a cork which seals when screwed on. As the bottle can only lay on its side the cork was kept moist, causing it to swell keeping it sealed. These figural scent bottles are usually attributed to Thomas Webb & Sons \u2013 one of the most successful glass companies of England operating in the Stourbridge area close to Birmingham. These virtually never come on the market and at auction it will probably swim to $2,500 or more.\nQ: My husband\u2019s brother inherited the ancestral home which contained a few antiques. No one knows how old this pitcher and bowl set is or where it came from, but we would like to know if it has any value. The name \u2018Walmer\u2019 and \u2018E.H.\u2019 are markings on the bottom. It is in very good shape.\nA: You have a very early brown transfer wash set dating to the 1850s. The \u2018Walmer\u2019 pattern is quite rare in transfer-decorated pottery. This is a romantic interpretation after the defensive castle built by Henry VIII in the 1500s. It is English and likely stands for Elijah Hughes & Co., of the Bleakhill Works, Cobridge in the Staffordshire region of England. The company operated from 1853 to 1867 making earthenwares. The shape of the pitcher and basin is typical for the 1840s and \u201950s with the eight-sided panels. It\u2019s a durable ironstone body and was also done in blue and white and an almost black mulberry. It\u2019s in remarkable condition and is worth $250 today.\nA: Delos Cline Bell is the artist. He is known mainly for oil paintings of portraits and genre scenes \u2014 and they are all rare. Yours extends the known period of his painting career as well as the geographic area he worked in since he is listed as being active from 1850 to 1877 in the areas of Hamilton (being born in Beamsville in 1829) and Ottawa. He died in 1918. His work is crisp with a slightly primitive element to it \u2014 a desirable characteristic that is also present in yours. The high detail of the house architecture and the garb of the four figures makes it historically interesting. This small piece of art will have collectors reaching in their pockets for at least $500.",
        "Seven years ago the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audited one out of every 90 individual income tax returns. Last year it was one out of every 119. This year it is expected to be just one out of every 143. And for those who don\u2019t include a Schedule C or other special (i.e., tax shelter, farm income) forms, the audit rate drops even further: one out of every 330.\nEven high-income earners (over $1 million a year) can breathe easier, at least for the moment. In 2015, the agency audited nearly 10 out of every 100 of those returns while this year it\u2019ll only be able to audit fewer than six. Business audits have also been declining. Four years ago the IRS audited nearly 10,000 businesses while last year that number dropped to just 6,453.\nThe decline is due to punishment through budget cuts by Congress for the agency\u2019s egregious mismanagement and malpractice behaviors including Commissioner John Koskinen\u2019s lying to Congress last year, which almost got him impeached, and the political profiling of Tea Party groups before that. The IRS now employs fewer than 80,000 people, down from 94,722 in 2010, with the enforcement staff seeing the most drastic declines: more than 30 percent since 2010.\nThe IRS has a history of overreach and mismanagement. In 2003, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals found IRS lawyers Kenneth McWade and William Sims guilty of blackmailing taxpayers in order to obtain testimony against other taxpayers. They consequently were disbarred. In May 2015, the agency announced that its computer systems had been hacked and that, as a result, the private tax information of more than 100,000 citizens had been stolen. In August of that year, the IRS said that the breach was far larger than originally thought: 220,000 additional private files had been compromised. A few months later, in February 2016, the IRS admitted that the previous disclosures were in error: More than 700,000 Social Security numbers and other \u201csensitive\u201d information had been stolen.\nAll of that appears to be ancient history with the new sheriff in town, President Donald Trump, and his deputy, Steven Mnuchin, heading up the Treasury Department. Mnuchin knows that for every 35 cents that it spends in collection efforts the IRS brings in $100. He knows that whistleblowers have brought in billions. He knows that the new program to revoke passports of those taxpayers owing more than $50,000 is likely to force them to pay up. He knows that for every $1 it spends on face-to-face audits with taxpayers the agency reaps $4 in return. He knows that for every dollar of new revenue it might receive from Congress it could generate between $4 and $6 dollars in revenue. He knows that Trump is a businessman very familiar with such numbers. Consequently Mnuchin thinks he can make a \u201creturn-on-investment\u201d case that could result in a significant increase in the IRS\u2019s current budget of $11 billion.\nDespite the new deputy in charge of the Treasury, which runs the IRS, Trump will likely have a tough time getting Congress to approve any more than a modest increase in the agency\u2019s budget. In the meantime taxpayers have a little more time to breathe a little easier.",

        "I ran away from home at the age of 40. It was a home I had wanted for a long time, walked past when I lived a few blocks away. I finally got my wish and was able to buy it. It was shaded by tall, mature trees; a treehouse had been constructed between the branches of a huge avocado tree. An apricot tree groaned with fruit during the summers.\nI was married at the time, and my then-husband and I added a new garage to the property, painted the inside of the house, transformed the kitchen. I spent hours in the garden creating flower beds, planting new trees.\nThe places we live seem to absorb the memories we are making. We turn a corner and collide with the past. I got divorced while living in the house shaded by trees. Newly single, I struggled through a couple of other relationships, both of them turbulent and destructive. I also rescued a baby squirrel and nurtured him into adulthood, turning the treehouse into his home.\nHis name was Squirmy, and he and my dog, Sadie, chased each other around for hours, bound by a mysterious agreement that neither would ever catch up to the other.\nBirds used to wait for me to put food on the bird feeder; they would line up on the wires overhead and descend as soon as I emerged from the house with a bag of seed.\nThe sweet memories are the ones I have retained, the ones that have bubbled to the surface after nearly six years. But when I abandoned my home, left it as if my life depended on escape, it was because I couldn't find the sweetness. I believed that, in fact, my life did depend on escape.\nMy career, my personal life, my internal landscapes all seemed war-torn and embattled. Rather than turning inward, I thought moving--changing my physical locale--would magically fix what was wrong. I had conveniently forgotten the wise observation that wherever you go, there you are.\nI was so committed to moving to the East Coast that I put my house up for sale in a declining market--a foolish move that proved costly. That's why I think of it as abandonment of something I should have treasured, why I look back on it as running away. So much was lost.\nFor years, I have punished myself for that decision. Even though living in New York for a few years was a positive, nourishing experience, I took my inner turbulence with me. What is so clear to me now--but wasn't then--is that moving forward in my life meant traveling inward; I could have done it in Manhattan or in Los Angeles, but I had to do it.\nI have now moved across the country twice. I have ended up back in Los Angeles, a happier person, a bit wiser, definitely calmer. I had to find in myself the writer I wanted to be, I had to repair the fractures in my family relationships first in my heart, and I had to address the fact that if I was drawn to bad romances, these could be found anywhere.\nGeography really had little or nothing to do with it. However, there is the home I lost, ran away from, really; there is the weight of a rash, immature choice, a hard memory.\nI don't live too far now from what was once my home, and I would like to live closer; I miss that neighborhood. The property itself has changed. The new owners added on to the house, removed some of the pines that shaded the garden. But two trees that I planted as saplings are now massive. It will never be the same as it was--only in my memory, and I have been dragging my memory behind me like a ball and chain.\nMy father used to tell me that God will give us an answer to any problem, dilemma or wound we bring him. \"If you ask God, he will answer you,\" my father would tell me. Here's something I've learned: Sometimes God answers us through other people.\nA friend of mine who was my neighbor when I lived in my tree-shaded house spoke the words I needed to hear. I confided to her that my decision to sell is still so difficult for me to cope with, to get beyond.\n\"Wait a minute here,\" she said. \"I was there for all that. I remember everything you were going through. You were unhappy, you were restless, and you felt if you moved, things might get better. You didn't set out to sabotage your life, you were trying to make it better. It's true that the cost was high, but look how you've grown as a person.\"\nI felt chains dropping off; I felt my memory stretching to take in the entire picture. I did what I thought I needed to do at the time. And there will be another home, another garden, which I will be better able to maintain as a peaceful, calm environment.\nWe lose places in our lives, but we leave things behind also. I planted two skinny saplings on land that I loved, that was my home for five years. They now bend over the lawn and reach to the sky; their trunks are thick and sturdy.\nAnd I learned an invaluable lesson. I learned that no matter how far, how fast I ran, I couldn't run away from myself. I learned it by trying to run, by trying to escape from myself in another city, another state, as if miles and jet streams were the answers. Maybe I couldn't have learned it any other way.\nMy friend was right, the cost was high. But there will be another home, and it will match the home I have found inside myself.",

Now her friends and family in Wyoming, Ill., are honoring the sacrifice she made to save her newborn daughter, reports KWQC. Carter, who had just turned 21 on Sunday, was alone with her baby Monday morning when their house went up in flames.

        "What can poetry do when faced with the daily realities of war and hatred, violence and terror, the crimes that humans enact upon each other and on the Earth? A cynic would answer nothing, would condemn the personal lyric as pure solipsism, an indulgence for the privileged few. But many 21st century poets are wrestling with questions of justice, writing at the intersection of history and intimacy, weaving political and social truth-telling into their private experiences.\nRobert Pinsky defended his art while serving as poet laureate: \u201cI think poetry is a vital part of our intelligence, our ability to learn, our ability to remember, the relationship between our bodies and minds,\u201d he told the Christian Science Monitor. Bay Area poets Solmaz Sharif and Tess Taylor prove this claim, help us learn and remember with their vital new collections.\nSharif\u2019s astonishing debut Look (Graywolf Press; $16) examines an endless cycle of war and violence, using a myriad of voices and forms.

        "The Cats have wrapped up on the field for the day--and a sweltering one it was----and here are a couple of observations that my pal Drew probably would have had out there a lot earlier, but he's enjoying a well-deserved day off.\n* The Cats are fast. Flat out, no modifiers.\n*The defence is so far ahead of last year at this point that it's useless to even try to compare. Huge defensive plays made several times by both Rico Murray and Pawel Kruba at linebacker. Some guys who made starts last year will not make this team, is our guess.\n*The Canadian depth of this team is ridiculously good, and we'll address that a bit in the main column today (which is about Ted Laurent).\n* Obviously, as the top of the five-man quarterback pyramid, Zach Collaros got the A reps in team and \"skelly\" sessions in Monday's second day of Tiger-Cat training camp. The bulk of the rest of the reps went to Jeremiah Masoli, No. 3 on the depth chart last year.\n\"The quarterbacks understand that there isn't enough time to get reps for them each day,\" explained head coach Ken Austin of the way pivot assignments will be handled in training camp. \"We don't have enough reps to distribute five deep, or even four deep.\n\"Sometimes there is a modification, though, because we do things by concept. So if a quarterback is short of reps on a certain concept, then we have to rotate it differently to make sure that he comes up to curve in some learning, where he didn't have enough reps.\n\"There is a lot that goes into it each night as we plan reps.\"\nHere's part of the plan, we'll guess: Collaros gets every rep he needs, especially with the prospect of a strike/lockout which could cost precious development time for a guy trying to go from a seven-game No. 2, to an 18-game No. 1.\n*Andy Fantuz has never held for a left-footed kicker. Justin Medlock returns to the team after a two-year NFL absence and, apparently, is still kicking with his left foot.\nFantuz said it's an adjustment because Medlock is not only left-footed, he does not use a kicking tee---Medlock says that's actually easier for a holder once he gets used to it---and because unlike other kickers Medlock does not like the ball held down from the top with one or two fingers or the whole hand, but likes the tip of the ball pinched between forefinger and thumb to make it easier to rotate, if necessary.\nMedlock says it'll take 200 practice snaps to get it right but will he have that with Fantuz, who's a first-stringer on offence?\nNo, it says here. That's one reason why Jason Boltus, third-string quarterback, was his holder here before. Receivers Luke Tasker and Corey Koch both with reliable, and big, hands like Fantuz are also asking for practice time as holder.\n*Austin was asked whether he'd like to carry five quarterbacks as he did last year.\n\"We're trying to push to about eight or nine,\" he quipped before adding. \"I don't know. if there's a ned to do that we will.\"\n* And how is Collaros making out in his adaptation to the Austin Way, which requires an awful lot of conceptual knowledge and reaction to what's playing out in front of him?\n\"He's improving a lot,\" Austin said. \" It doesn't matter what new system you go into, there's new terminology. It's like Greek af first. First you have to get comfortable with the terminology then you have to understand WHY we're doing what we're doing, and not just what. You can't have a robotic memory, coming out on this football field, you have to learn conceptually because of our adjustments. That takes time to sink in, but Zach's doing agreat job right now in his understanding and progression of learning.\"\nTed doesn't only look big he plays big.\nMasoli (well, Austin's brilliance) got us home field advantage last year.\nWhat a difference a gm makes. Old picked up other teams castoffs. Even Glenn was cut even before training camp in Peg. Before comming here as saviour. New: even last years starters might not make team ?! Wow. From replacing garbage with garbage to replacing starters with stars!!\nAnd fast! I was wondering how our new QB was doing myself, even after only 2 days so thanks for addressing it, Mr Steve!\n2014: the Year of the Cats!\nIt is truly great to hear (but I'm not really surprised) that the Ticats are way ahead of where they were last season. Continuity of coaching staff and keeping the core of players together will do that. With a new QB, offense could take a bit longer to come together but then that was true last year when EVERYONE was learning a new system. Great to hear too that there is lots of speed, some of which was evident at times last season.\nAs for Medlock's holder - I would think that they might try out someone who is NOT a first string player. Last year when Fantuz was injured Congi had to adjust to a different holder (Bartel). Of course any player could be injured during the season, but using a backup (like they did with Boltus - maybe Lauther would work?) might avoid the possibility of having to substitute someone less familiar (or completely unfamiliar) with Medlock's style in case of injury.\nThe man just known as Ted.\n@Ryan y - How well he's coming along? It's Day 2 of camp... isn't it a little early to be asking that? We heard a bit of feedback after the OTA, but still, what else is a coach supposed to say at this point? And what are reporters supposed to be noticing when the drills have just been getting under way?\nRe: holders for placekicking, I'm curious about the thinking behind continuing to use a receiver to do the job, versus one of the backup QBs - they can certainly run the ball if the snap is botched, but you'd think having someone like Masoli or LeFevour doing it would open up more options on a broken placekick.\nIs it just me or are the ticats and reporters Being VERY careful about raising the fans expectations about how well Collaros is coming along? There have no articles about how great he is doing and Kent Austin gives the same cookie cutter responses whenever a reporter asks. I don't know maybe I've gotten used to the nfls reporters and their hyperbole over the off season but it scares me. This guy played one very bad preseason game last year I remember thinking wow he's terrible and lost the backup job to the argos Harris. I'm not sure how he ended up being second string again when Ricky went down but this kid is a HUGE gamble. And I think people should start to gear back the expectations a bit about a return to and winning the grey cup this year I think this kid might need a year or two to learn the game and become what all his potential says he could be.\nCould have used Laurent last year! Should have used the Gaydosh pick to get him! Oh well, better late than never.\nAlso agree that speed is good... Just look at how dangerous our STs were when Thigpen or Williams were returning the kicks for TDs.\nI haven't had a chance to get to camp yet... So will rely on others... How does Plesius look at MLB?\nGlad to hear team is fast; as many coaches have said \"you can't coach/teach speed\".\nNot surprised Masoli is 2nd QB (so far). I think he adds a quite different dimension to Ticat offence, whereas Lefevour is very similar in skills to Collaros.\nSigning of Laurent is huge, Ticats will have so many ratio options this year.",

Numsa\u2019s Cosatu membership was nullified in 2014 following disagreements with the federation.\nVavi said the South African trade union movement had become fragmented and weakened, with only 24 percent of workers being members of any union.\n\u201cThat is why there is such a groundswell of support for a workers summit and not just a new union federation but a fundamentally different one, based on worker control, internal democracy, non-racialism, gender equality, international solidarity and political independence,\u201d he said.\nVavi said the new federation would shy away from politics and concentrate on representing interests of workers. Cosatu is part of South Africa\u2019s ruling alliance with the African National Congress.\n\u201cWorkers are crying out for an independent, fighting of organisation that works with the civil society that have ties with other trade unions fighting the same course all over the world that are not just politically independent,\u201d he said.\nA number of Cosatu affiliates including the Food and Allied Workers Union, South African Football Players Union, South African Commercial Catering and Allied Workers Union, and Public and Allied Workers Union of South Africa are some of the unions that have been linked to Vavi\u2019s initiative.\nSolidarity\u2019s Gideon du Plesssis said the new federation had been trying to lure his union but they had ideological differences.\n\u201cThe founders have already been flirting with Solidarity for quite a while to win the union\u2019s support and cooperation but on account of ideological and other differences, Solidarity will not join the federation; yet, in areas where we could share interests such as campaigns against corruption, electricity crises and service delivery, the new federation may certainly count on our support,\u201d he wrote for Biznews.",

        "Courtesy Redwood City. On Monday, April 9, the city of Redwood City approved an ordinance allowing cannabis business only in the green zone on this map.\nRedwood City is open for cannabis business, but marijuana operators aren\u2019t particularly high about the terms.\nAs far as they\u2019re concerned, the city is banishing them to the industrial side of town and imposing overly restrictive rules.\nAt its Monday night meeting, the City Council voted 5-2 \u2014 with Jeffrey Gee and Vice Mayor Diane Howard dissenting \u2014 to approve an ordinance that establishes a zone where recreational marijuana wholesale businesses and indoor commercial-use nurseries can operate. That zone encompasses Seaport Boulevard east of Highway 101 and some areas west of the freeway on Veterans Boulevard. That\u2019s where medical marijuana businesses before them primarily were relegated to.\nCity planners say those areas have a 3.89 percent vacancy rate, a fact they considered to be enticing to businesses.\nUnder the ordinance, the nurseries can only grow marijuana seeds, clones and immature plants and sell them just to wholesalers or commercial businesses, not individuals. They must provide 24-hour security and cannot operate within 1,000 feet of schools, youth centers, public parks and libraries. The state only requires them to be a minimum of 600 feet from schools.\nIn addition to medical marijuana deliveries that began in 2012, the ordinance allows recreational marijuana deliveries to businesses that obtain a business license in the city.\nKali-Rai, who also is a paid consultant for Harvest Bloom, one of the medical marijuana companies established in San Carlos with an administrative office in Redwood City.

        "WASHINGTON-(ENEWSPF)\u2013December 1, 2016 \u2014 The invasion of Islamic State of Iraq and The Levant forces into Iraq two years ago has met with a \u201cremarkable turn-around,\u201d British Army Maj. Gen. Rupert Jones, deputy commander, Combined Joint Task Force Operation Inherent Resolve told reporters yesterday.\nIn a teleconferenced feed from Baghdad, Jones said the coalition\u2019s training of Iraqi forces has been key in the campaign to defeat ISIL. \u201cIt\u2019s been well over a year since [ISIL] last defeated an Iraqi force, although they continue to resist,\u201d he said, noting that more than 4,500 forces are training now to sustain the Iraqi forces and establish wide-area security and holding forces when Mosul has been retaken.\n\u201cWe\u2019re a coalition of more than 60 nations, united against [ISIL]. And we\u2019re very proud that so many have offered contributions to fight against [ISIL\u2019s] twisted ideology here in Iraq, in Syria, and other locations around the world,\u201d he said.\nThe coalition has trained more than 63,000 fighters and many are in combat operations in Mosul and other locations around Iraq, he said.\nThe OIR deputy commander said the Iraqi forces continue to progress in their advance on Mosul, and while ISIL has lost significant amounts of territory in the city\u2019s eastern sector, the enemy has used snipers and indirect fire, mortars and rockets \u201cto terrorize civilians in areas that have been ripped away from their control. They\u2019ve also used suicide vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices to attack the advancing Iraqi security forces,\u201d he said.\nIn response, and at the Iraqi government\u2019s request, U.S.-led coalition forces struck and disabled four of the five bridges connecting east and west Mosul, and increased terrain-denial missions, Jones said.\n\u201cThe intent of these operations is to reduce the effectiveness of the vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices. This combination of the two tactics seems to be reducing the number of VBIEDs the enemy has been able to use,\u201d he said.\nSurrounded by a superior coalition force, the enemy has little ability to resupply or reinforce their fighters, he said, adding since the counterattack to liberate Mosul began Oct. 17, the coalition has relentlessly bombarded the enemy.\n\u201cThe coalition has supported the Iraqi advance with more than 4,800 precision bombs, artillery shells, missiles and rockets against [ISIL] fighters and resources,\u201d he added.\nIn Syria, the Syrian Democratic Forces having recaptured more than 270 square miles of terrain from ISIL, and are planning the next phase of isolation of Raqqa, Jones said.\n\u201cThey\u2019re now less than [18 miles] from the city and have encountered light to moderate resistance as they continue clearing villages along the axis of advance,\u201d Jones said.\nThe SDF is also back-clearing the areas they control to reduce ISIL\u2019s ability to reinfiltrate or attack using sleeper cells. \u201cThe coalition continues supporting their operations with air strikes, having delivered more than 600 munitions onto enemy targets,\u201d he said.",
        "The Jeep Grand Cherokee is one of the brightest stars among the cars that propelled Chrysler--now controlled by Fiat--to a 26-percent sales increase in 2011, raising its share of the U.S. market 1.3 points to 10.7 percent.\nYesterday, the company said it would start building a diesel version of the Grand Cherokee next year, its first diesel passenger vehicle in several years.\nThat confirms a statement by Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne from last April that the popular Jeep crossover would get a diesel option, which he reiterated in October.\nThe new clean-diesel sport-utility vehicle was buried in an announcement that Chrysler would add a third production shift at its Jefferson North assembly plant in Detroit next year, hiring 1,100 new workers in the process.\nThat plant now builds the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Durango, and will eventually add low-volume production of a Maserati sport-utility vehicle previewed by the Kubang concept at the Frankfurt Motor Show last fall.\nThere's already a diesel version of the Grand Cherokee built in the plant, mind you, but it's sold only in Europe, where diesel vehicles make up roughly 50 percent of new-car sales. It was unveiled last spring at the Geneva Motor Show, using a turbodiesel engine from VM Motori.\nThe European version has a 3.0-liter V-6 diesel offered in two different states of tune. The more powerful has 241 horsepower and 406 pound-feet of torque, the lesser version is rated at 190 horsepower and 325 pound-feet.\nThe more powerful version accelerates from 0 to 62 mph in 8.2 seconds, and is rated at 28.4 mpg on the European test cycle. That testing procedure usually returns fuel efficiency figures about 20 percent higher than the U.S. test, so we might expect combined fuel economy of 23 or 24 mpg.\nThe most economical current version of the 2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee, fitted with the brand's Pentastar 3.6-liter V-6 gasoline engine and a five-speed automatic transmission, is rated by the EPA at 19 mpg combined for its rear-wheel drive model.\nAnd the Grand Cherokee is likely to be the first of many clean diesel models sold across the Jeep, Chrysler, and Dodge brands. A turbodiesel Dodge Durango crossover, built on the same underpinnings as the Jeep crossover, would be easy. Analysts say that the Chrysler 300 and Dodge Charger large sedans will also get oil burners.\nClean-diesel vehicles are now sold in the U.S. only by four European brands: Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Volkswagen, with the bulk of those sales coming from the mass-market VW Jetta TDI and Golf TDI models.\nBut Porsche just announced it would sell its Cayenne Diesel luxury sport-utility vehicle this year in the States.\nThe first U.S. brand to offer a new diesel passenger car may be Chevrolet, which will sell a Cruze diesel compact sedan for the 2013 model year.",
        "Taking a deeper look into the list of recipients of political parties' protection money* in 2019, it appears as though a significant portion thereof will be going to nonprofits connected to party members.\nThe list of recipients of the protection money being distributed by the three coalition parties includes sports associations, village societies, schools, kindergartens and churches. Of the three parties, Centre and Pro Patria are the most generous toward churches, earmarking funds for the renovation of a whole host of houses of worship; the Social Democratic Party (SDE), meanwhile, will be supporting the renovation of just a few.\nIt stands out, however, that parties are not planning on missing the opportunity to use allotted protection money to give a boost to their members' nonprofits.\nFor example, one of the Centre Party's largest planned financial contributions, totalling \u20ac100,000, is to go to the nonprofit T\u00f6\u00f6stuspark Intec-Nakro, one of the two board members of which is a member of the Centre Party \u2014 Narva city councilmember Fjodor Ovsjannikov, who has been convicted of corruption.\nCentre's contribution of \u20ac50,000 to the nonprofit Voore made the news last year as Voore board member Kristjan Sakk is partners with Centre Party member Ekri Savisaar. The nonprofit is slated to receive another cash injection from the ruling party, which has earmarked \u20ac17,000 for the development of a 3D marketing platform for manors.\nAnother \u20ac50,000 in operational support has been earmarked for the Estonian Tenants' Union, on the board of which serve Centre Party members Urmi Reinde and Heimar Lenk.\n\u20ac12,000 is to go to the nonprofit Talendipank, the board of which includes Centre members Sten-Erik Jantson and Tiina Jantson. According to its annual report, the nonprofit organises beauty pageants.\nThe Viisu Village Society, on which serves Centre Party member and Paide City Council chairman Aivar Tubli, is to receive \u20ac20,000 for the reconstruction of a park.\nThe Centre Party has also earmarked \u20ac5,000 for J\u00f5geva Hospital, whose director, Peep P\u00f5dder, is not only a member of the party himself, but the personal doctor of former longtime Centre Party chairman Edgar Savisaar.\nOf Pro Patria's protection money, \u20ac100,000 is to go to the nonprofit Konstantin P\u00e4ts Museum with the aim of erecting a monument to P\u00e4ts. Three of the nonprofit's five board members are members of Pro Patria, including Trivimi Velliste.\n\u20ac50,000 is going toward the development of the cooperation network of the Society of Villages of Taheva Municipality. This nonprofit's sole board member, Monika Rogenbaum, is a member of Pro Patria. Another \u20ac50,000 is to go to the nonprofit R\u00f5uge Sports Club, two board members of which, Jaak P\u00e4chter and Oliver Ossipov, are likewise members of Pro Patria.\nThe nonprofit Kalev Yacht Club, whose board includes Pro Patria member Kalev Vapper is to receive \u20ac25,000 for the renovation of its port infrastructure. The Jaan T\u00f5nisson Institute, whose sole board member Andrus Villem is likewise a member of the party, is to receive the same amount.\nPro Patria member Tiit Salvan serves on the board of the nonprofit Toila-Ontika Merekuurort, which is to receive \u20ac23,000 for community facilities and \u20ac10,000 for solar-powered bus station lighting.\nThe Hiiumaa Heritage Society, on the board of which serves Pro Patria member and local municipal council member Tiit Harjak, is to receive \u20ac15,000 for the planning of a local War of Independence monument.\nThe Social Democratic Party (SDE), meanwhile, has earmarked \u20ac36,000 for the Tartu County Farmers' Union, whose director is SDE member Jaan S\u00f5rra. Another \u20ac45,000 is to go to the Tilsi Stadium Foundation, whose board includes SDE member Sirje Tobreluts.\nThe Tartu County Central Folklore Association, whose board includes Social Democrat Ants Johanson, is to receive \u20ac10,000 for the renovation and purchase of premises. The nonprofit V\u00e4ike V\u00e4in Society, on whose board serve SDE members Andres Hanso and Heiki Hanso, is likewise to receive \u20ac10,000, which is to pay for an environmental analysis.\nAlso to receive \u20ac10,000 each are the Vaiatu Village Society, whose board includes SDE member Mati Kepp, S\u00f5merpalu Care Home, whose sole board member is Social Democrat Lenhard Ermel, and the Estonian Nordic Walking Union, whose board includes SDE member Rein Randver.\nNo such striking ties were detected in the recipients of the opposition parties' financial contributions. The Conservative People's Party of Estonia (EKRE) divided its total of \u20ac300,000 evenly between the Hille T\u00e4navsuu Cancer Treatment Foundation, the Estonian Women's Shelters Union and the Tartu University Hospital Children's Foundation.\nThe Free Party had a total of \u20ac227,000 in protection money to distribute, and only one recipient, the nonprofit Pelgulinn Society, had party members also serving on its board. The neighbourhood society is to receive \u20ac8,000 in support for the purchase of inventory as well as operational subsidies.\nThe Reform Party rejected its portion of protection money.\n*This distribution of funds referred to in Estonian as katuseraha \u2014 protection money \u2014 goes back to the 1990s. A certain amount of money was reserved to be allocated at the discretion of the Riigikogu's members to satisfy different parties' interests. The arrangement is still in place, discussed towards the end of every year, and acts as a sort of grease in the process of getting a majority for the state budget bill.\nParty protection money: storm in a teacup or embarrassing anachronism?",
        "LONDON, May 16 (Reuters) - The pesticide glyphosate, sold by Monsanto in its Roundup weed killer product and widely used in agriculture and by gardeners, is unlikely to cause cancer in people, according to a new safety review by United Nations health, agriculture and food experts.\nIn a statement likely to intensify a row over its potential health impact, experts from the U.N.\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and World Health Organization (WHO) said glyphosate is \u201cunlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans\u201d exposed to it through food. It is mostly used on crops.\nHaving reviewed the scientific evidence, the joint WHO/FAO committee also said glyphosate is unlikely to be genotoxic in humans. In other words, it is not likely to have a destructive effect on cells\u2019 genetic material.\nDiazinon and malathion, two other pesticides reviewed by the committee, which met last week and published its conclusions on Monday, were also found to be unlikely to be carcinogenic.\n\u201cIn view of the absence of carcinogenic potential in rodents at human-relevant doses and the absence of genotoxicity by the oral route in mammals, and considering the epidemiological evidence from occupational exposures, the meeting concluded that glyphosate is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans from exposure through the diet,\u201d the committee said.\nGlyphosate is also \u201cunlikely to be genotoxic at anticipated dietary exposures\u201d, it added.\nThe group reaffirmed an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of up to 1 milligram of glyphosate for every kilogram of body weight.\nThe conclusions appear to contradict a finding by the WHO\u2019s Lyon-based International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), which in March 2015 said glyphosate is \u201cprobably\u201d able to cause cancer in humans and classified it as a \u2018Group 2A\u2019 carcinogen.\nSeven months after the IARC review, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), an independent agency funded by the European Union, published a different assessment, saying glyphosate is \u201cunlikely to pose a carcinogenic hazard to humans\u201d.\nThe United States\u2019 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which first assessed glyphosate in 1986 and has reviewed it several times since then, had also previously concluded it has \u201clow toxicity for humans\u201d.\nThe differing findings thrust glyphosate into the centre of a row involving EU and U.S. politicians and regulators, the IARC experts, the WHO and environmental and agricultural scientists.\nThe EU\u2019s pesticides committee is due to meet later this week to decide whether to re-license glyphosate. The U.S. EPA is being investigated for withdrawing a report saying the chemical is probably not carcinogenic.\nIn a question-and-answer document issued alongside the joint FAO/WHO statement, the WHO denied that the conclusions by the joint group and by IARC were contradictory. It said they were \u201cdifferent, yet complementary\u201d, with the IARC assessment focussed on hazard while the other looked at risk.\nIn contrast, it said, the joint FAO/WHO committee looks at published and unpublished studies to assess the health risk to consumers from dietary exposure to pesticide residues in food.",

        "Too many potions muddle the alchemy in \"The Great Magician,\" a picaresque romance set around the rivalry between a warlord and a conjurer in 1920s China.\nToo many potions muddle the alchemy in \u201cThe Great Magician,\u201d a picaresque romance set around the rivalry between a warlord and a conjurer in 1920s China. Absent the psychological tension, technical showmanship and stylistic sleight-of-hand of \u201cThe Prestige,\u201d this yarn from Hong Kong writer-helmer Derek Yee is unable to harmonize a mix of political intrigue and vaudevillian humor, while an excess of magic acts keeps the sterling cast too physically busy to breathe feeling into their roles. Out of touch with contempo urban tastes, the pic is unlikely to conjure dazzling B.O. in China or satisfy overseas cravings for martial arts-centric titles.\nNorthern China in the \u201920s is embroiled in territorial feuds between warlords, one of whom is is Lei Daniu, aka Bully (Sean Lau Ching-wan), who uses the mentalist skills of his butler, Liu Kunshan (Wu Gang), to recruit soldiers. Bully is besotted with pretty acrobat Yin (Zhou Xun), whom he captured and forcibly made his seventh concubine while her fiance was in Europe. Meanwhile, Yin\u2019s magician father, Liu Wanyao (the helmer\u2019s brother, Paul Chun), has disappeared.\nWhen the mysterious Zhang Xian (Tony Leung Chiu-wai) arrives in Beijing to stage spectacular magic shows, Bully seeks his help to impress the frosty Yin. To his consternation, the suave and Westernized Zhang is more beguiling than he bargained for.\nased on Zhang Haifan\u2019s novel of the same title, the screenplay by Yee, Chun Tin-nam and Lau Ho-leung plays down the book\u2019s dramatization of the cultural encounter between Western and Eastern magic. In fact, more plot similarities can be found with Neil Burger\u2019s \u201cThe Illusionist,\u201d though without that film\u2019s sustained mystique and ingenious plotting. Yin\u2019s divided affections never build to a full-blown romantic triangle; the main trio\u2019s first encounter arrives a leisurely half-hour after the scene is set and periphery characters are introduced. The midsection, in which Bully and Zhang try to suss each other out, coasts on the playful charm of the two actors, but delivers no high-concept feats. Eventually, the lead story is overtaken by inane subplots involving a lost alchemy formula, Japanese spies masquerading as filmmakers, and a Manchurian monarchist conspiracy.\nThe pic attempts to re-create the rapture of spectatorship in an era when magic appears as powerful as sorcery to a more gullible public. It works initially, such as when Zhang plays with fire or nimbly manipulates silk-screen paintings to re-enact his romantic past. However, rather than focusing on a few grand setpieces, the film features wall-to-wall magic, some of which is purely gimmicky, which inevitably strips it of mystery.\nAn exploration of magic and cinema as parallel mediums, capable of enchanting as well as deluding the masses, has as much relevance now as it did in \u201920s China, which also featured a burgeoning economy that bred unprecedented avarice and, with it, new levels of con artistry. Yee tentatively reflects on this phenomenon, but his tendency to moralize (obvious also in his \u201cProtege\u201d and \u201cShinjuku Incident\u201d) brings the film to a banal conclusion.\nPerfs are sound but not exceptional. Leung, who last graced the screen in 2009\u2019s \u201cRed Cliff II,\u201d looks a bit old for the Casanova role, and is initially rather wooden; he doesn\u2019t warm up until he\u2019s left alone to banter with Lau. Gamine Zhou easily convinces as a femme to die for, but doesn\u2019t invite deeper examination of her character or thoughts. Lau offers the most consistent turn as a wild card who keeps one guessing about his true nature until the end. Supporting turns by Wu (who had so much more presence in \u201cIp Man\u201d) and Yan (brassy as usual), plus cameos by Daniel Wu, Alex Fong and Tsui Hark, only mildly enhance the mix.\nVisual effects are refined without being tastelessly showy, and Yee Chung-man\u2019s costumes are stylishly color-coordinated with the lush decor. Production design and lighting look particularly rich and luminous, paying loving homage to the folksy northern ambience and studio-set look of Li Han-hsiang\u2019s 1970s warlord comedy-satires and trickster capers.\nStephen Tung Wai\u2019s action choreography serviceably integrates magic into martial arts, but larger-scale street fights are pedestrian.\nProduction: An Emperor Motion Picture (in Hong Kong), Bona Entertainment Co.

        "REPORTER (Jeff Mason from Reuters): For President Putin if I could follow up as well. Why should Americans and why should President Trump believe your statement that Russia did not intervene in the 2016 election given the evidence that US Intelligence agencies have provided? Will you consider extraditing the 12 Russian officials that were indicted last week by a US Grand jury.\nTRUMP: Well I\u2019m going to let the president [meaning Putin] answer the second part of that question.\nAs you know, the concept of that came up perhaps a little before, but it came out as a reason why the Democrats lost an election, which frankly, they should have been able to win, because the electoral college is much more advantageous for Democrats, as you know, than it is to Republicans. [That allegation from Trump is unsupported, and could well be false.] We won the electoral college by a lot. 306 to 223, I believe. [It was actually 304 to 227.] That was a well-fought battle. We did a great job.\nFrankly, I\u2019m going to let the president speak to the second part of your question. But, just to say it one time again and I say it all the time, there was no collusion. I didn\u2019t know the president. There was nobody to collude with. There was no collusion with the campaign. Every time you hear all of these 12 and 14 \u2014 it\u2019s stuff that has nothing to do \u2014 and frankly, they admit, these are not people involved in the campaign. But to the average reader out there, they are saying, well maybe that does. It doesn\u2019t. Even the people involved, some perhaps told mis-stories. In one case the FBI said there was no lie. There was no lie. Somebody else said there was. We ran a brilliant campaign. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m president. Thank you.\nPUTIN: As to who is to be believed, who is not to be believed: you can trust no one. Where did you get this idea that President Trump trusts me or I trust him? He defends the interests of the United States of America and I do defend the interests of the Russian Federation. We do have interests that are common. We are looking for points of contact.\nThere are issues where our postures diverge and we are looking for ways to reconcile our differences, how to make our effort more meaningful. We should not proceed from the immediate political interests that guide certain political powers in our countries. We should be guided by facts. Could you name a single fact that would definitively prove the collusion? This is utter nonsense \u2014 just like the president recently mentioned. Yes, the public at large in the United States had a certain perceived opinion of the candidates during the campaign. But there\u2019s nothing particularly extraordinary about it. That\u2019s the normal thing.\nPresident Trump, when he was a candidate, he mentioned the need to restore the Russia/US relationship, and it\u2019s clear that certain parts of American society felt sympathetic about it and different people could express their sympathy in different ways. Isn\u2019t that natural? Isn\u2019t it natural to be sympathetic towards a person who is willing to restore the relationship with our country, who wants to work with us?\nWe heard the accusations about it. As far as I know, this company hired American lawyers and the accusations doesn\u2019t have a fighting chance in the American courts. There\u2019s no evidence when it comes to the actual facts. So we have to be guided by facts, not by rumors.\nNow, let\u2019s get back to the issue of this 12 alleged intelligence officers of Russia. I don\u2019t know the full extent of the situation. But President Trump mentioned this issue. I will look into it.\nSo far, I can say the following. Things that are off the top of my head. We have an existing agreement between the United States of America and the Russian Federation, an existing treaty that dates back to 1999. The mutual assistance on criminal cases. This treaty is in full effect. It works quite efficiently. On average, we initiate about 100, 150 criminal cases upon request from foreign states.\nFor instance, the last year, there was one extradition case upon the request sent by the United States. This treaty has specific legal procedures we can offer. The appropriate commission headed by Special Attorney Mueller, he can use this treaty as a solid foundation and send a formal, official request to us so that we could interrogate, hold questioning of these individuals who he believes are privy to some crimes. Our enforcement are perfectly able to do this questioning and send the appropriate materials to the United States. Moreover, we can meet you halfway. We can make another step. We can actually permit representatives of the United States, including the members of this very commission headed by Mr. Mueller, we can let them into the country. They can be present at questioning.\nIn this case, there\u2019s another condition. This kind of effort should be mutual one. Then we would expect that the Americans would reciprocate. They would question officials, including the officers of law enforcement and intelligence services of the United States whom we believe have something to do with illegal actions on the territory of Russia. And we have to request the presence of our law enforcement.\nFor instance, we can bring up Mr. Browder in this particular case. Business associates of Mr. Browder have earned over $1.5 billion in Russia. They never paid any taxes. Neither in Russia nor in the United States. Yet, the money escapes the country. They were transferred to the United States. They sent huge amount of money, $400 million as a contribution to the campaign of Hillary Clinton. [He presents no evidence to back up that $400 million claim.] Well, that\u2019s their personal case. It might have been legal, the contribution itself. But the way the money was earned was illegal. We have solid reason to believe that some intelligence officers guided these transactions. [This allegation, too, is merely an unsupported assertion here.] So we have an interest of questioning them. That could be a first step. We can also extend it. There are many options. They all can be found in an appropriate legal framework.\nREPORTER (Jeff Mason from Reuters): Did you direct any of your officials to help him [Trump] do that [find those \u2018options\u2019]?\nPUTIN: Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because he talked about bringing the US/Russia relationship back to normal.\nThe evidence regarding that entire matter, of Bill Browder and the Magnitsky Act, can be seen in the links and the other evidences that are presented in two articles that I published on that very subject, earlier this year. One, titled \u201cPrivate Investigations Find America\u2019s Magnitsky Act to Be Based on Frauds\u201d, summarizes the independently done private investigations into the evidence that is publicly available online regarding Bill Browder and the Magnitsky Act. The Magnitsky Act was the basis for the first set of economic sanctions against Russia, and were instituted in 2012; so, this concerns the start of the restoration of the Cold War (without the communism etc. that were allegedly the basis of Cold War I). The other article, \u201cRussiagate-Trump Gets Solved by Giant of American Investigative Journalism\u201d, provides further details in the evidence, and connects both the Magnitsky Act and Bill Browder to the reason why, on 9 June 2016, the Russian lawyer Nataliya Veselnitskaya, met privately at Trump Tower, with Donald Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, and Jared Kushner \u2014 the reason was specifically in order to inform them about the documentation on this case, so that Trump, if elected, would be aware of the contents of those documents. She had used the promise of dirt on Hillary so as to enable Trump, who effectively became the Republican nominee on 26 May 2016, to learn about the actual documents in this crucial case.\nThe Russian government has been legally pursuing Mr. Browder, for years, on charges that he evaded paying $232 million taxes that were due to the Russian government. These private investigations into this matter \u2014 regarding whether or not the Magnitsky Act was based on fraudulent grounds \u2014 have all found that Mr. Browder has clearly falsified and misrepresented the actual documents, which are linked to in those two articles I wrote. These might be the very same documents that she was presenting on June 9th.\nSo: this is a matter of importance not only to the validity (or not) of the Magnitsky Act economic sanctions against Russia, but to the Russiagate accusations regarding U.S. President Donald Trump.

Macura, forward Kerem Kanter, forward Kaiser Gates, forward Sean O\u2019Mara.\nWho\u2019s back: Junior point guard Quentin Goodin (8.7 point per game) is Xavier\u2019s most experienced returning player and will be one of the team\u2019s leaders, along with sophomore forward Naji Marshall, who started 18 games last season. Marshall averaged 7.7 points and is Xavier\u2019s most diverse offensive player. Forward Tyrique Jones (7 ppg, 4.5 rebounds) is counted on to play a bigger scoring role on the front line. Sophomore guard Paul Scruggs (4.9 ppg) also moves into an expanded role.\nWho\u2019s new: Three graduate students. Forward Zach Hankins set school records for blocked shots and field goal percentage at Ferris State. Guard Ryan Welage set the school record for 3-pointers in three seasons at San Jose State. Guard Kyle Castlin is a team captain after coming over from Columbia, where he averaged 10.5 points and 3.8 rebounds per game.\nThe Skinny: Xavier is in a transition season with a new head coach and a significantly different roster. The Musketeers lost five of their top seven scorers including Bluiett, who averaged 19.3 points per game. Xavier was ranked as high as No. 3 last season, won its first Big East regular season title and got its first No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament before blowing a 12-point lead and losing in the second round. Steele was Mack\u2019s top assistant and moved up when Mack went to Louisville.\nExpectations: Las Vegas oddsmakers have Xavier as a long shot to win the NCAA Tournament at 120-1, on par with Louisville, St. John\u2019s and Butler. Defending national champion Villanova is one of the top favorites at 10-1.\nCINCINNATI (AP) \u2014 With a senior-laden team, Xavier won its first Big East regular season championship and got its first No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament. A second-round loss abruptly ended everything and began a transition that\u2019s still in progress entering the new season.\nCoach Chris Mack left for Louisville and was replaced by Travis Steele , his top assistant. Five of the top seven scorers are gone, including Trevon Bluiett, who averaged 19.3 point per game. And the Musketeers find themselves with a lot of newness as they open the Steele era.\nNo matter who was the head coach, the Musketeers would have been expected to take a step back because of the turnover from their 29-6 season. Their top three scorers were seniors Bluitt and J.P. Macura (12.9 points per game) and graduate transfer Kerem Kanter (10.9).\nWhat\u2019s left is a roster with limited experience in Xavier\u2019s system. Three graduate transfers will fill it out, but they have to get used to playing a different style.\nNEW LEADER: Goodin was among the players who lobbied for Steele to get the head coaching job, providing stability in the program. Steele is staying with Xavier\u2019s offensive and defensive systems, though tweaking them to account for the significant roster change. Goodin said Steele has kept most things the same.\nTRIO OF GRADUATE TRANSFERS: Forward Zach Hankins set school records for blocked shots and field goal percentage at Ferris State. Guard Ryan Welage set the school record for 3-pointers in three seasons at San Jose State. Guard Kyle Castlin is a team captain after coming over from Columbia, where he averaged 10.5 points and 3.8 rebounds per game. All three are counted upon to play significant roles during their one season at Xavier.\nYOUNGER LEADERS: With no seniors who came up through Xavier\u2019s program, the Musketeers are counting on Goodin, junior Tyrique Jones, and sophomores Naji Marshall and Paul Scruggs to provide more leadership as the newcomers learn their way.\nGETTING DEFENSIVE: Xavier\u2019s defense slipped last season, often allowing teams to go on long runs that got them back into games. The perimeter defense was a problem in particular. Steele has tweaked the Musketeers\u2019 man-to-man defense to try to get more turnovers and transition baskets.\nNEW BIG EAST LOOK: The top two teams in the league have undergone significant roster changes \u2014 Xavier the regular-season champion and Villanova the national champion. With those two teams in transition, there\u2019s room for others to rise up in the league, especially in the early going.",
        "This image from Rethink81 shows what Almond Street might look like without the Interstate 81 viaduct. The CNY Chapter of the American Institute of Architects supports demolition of the highway in favor of a Community Grid plan that would bring life and commerce into spaces now in the shadow of the interstate.\nClose your eyes and visualize a mini Park Avenue in New York City, or Millennium Park in Chicago. These urban areas are pedestrian-friendly spaces with a mix of high-rises and street-level mixed-use properties. These locations, home to some of the most valuable real estate in the world, are also critical components of a city street grid.\nThe I-81 Viaduct Project is an opportunity for our region to think big. Not a big new highway, but grand and innovative ideas on what to do with the (hopefully) soon-to-be former viaduct corridor.\nSelecting the Community Grid option over replacing the current Viaduct with a newer, bigger highway should be a \"no-brainer.\" Removing the elevated highway will open up a range of opportunities for our region; to further reinvigorate the city, to reconnect divided communities and to stimulate unprecedented growth.\nSyracuse was one of many cities across the country which made the fateful urban planning decision in the 1950s and 1960s to build elevated highways through their urban centers. In every case, the neighborhoods in the shadows of the viaducts suffered a similar fate; abandonment and isolation, reduced property values, pollution and noise. Beyond the socio-economic impacts on neighborhoods, city highways severely limit economic development, and they are not terribly efficient, either. Have you ever been one of the 44,000 people a day who use Exit 18 (Harrison/Adams) during the morning and evening commute?\nToday, cities like San Francisco, New Orleans, Boston, Dallas and New Haven have already, or are in the process of, tearing down elevated city highways. In Milwaukee, where the Park East Freeway was razed in 1999, urban development has flourished with property values in the affected area increasing by 45 percent. In 2007, Manpower relocated its 900-employee global headquarters to a site in downtown Milwaukee formerly occupied by elevated the highway.\nThis can happen in Syracuse.\nThe economics favor the Community Grid option as well. The Grid costs $400 million less than the Viaduct, which also takes longer to build and requires increasing annual maintenance costs over the next 50-plus years. Equally important, the Community Grid stimulates economic growth. There is a need to re-densify the city, especially in walkable areas like those around Almond Avenue. Walkable zones attract people and development generating sales and property tax revenue. We have an opportunity to revitalize the valuable areas currently shadowed by I-81.\nIn addition to the community-building and economic development benefits, there are compelling logistics arguments for the Community Grid. Eighty-eight percent of the traffic on the existing viaduct consists of people travelling to the city - most for work. The current highway, however, is designed to help cars bypass the city altogether.\nThe Community Grid design taps into the existing infrastructure, dispersing traffic throughout the city grid by promoting broader use of the existing underutilized street network. The design provides direct connections to key destinations in the city and adds new exits to ease congestion and further spread traffic. In the grid, instead of one path to their destination, drivers will have multiple access points.\nThe grid design is also the least disruptive option, requiring the acquisition of just five buildings. The construction of a new Viaduct will condemn and demolish 24 buildings, including at least 12 structures of historical significance.\nThe American Institute of Architects Central New York chapter created the AIACNY81 Task Force in 2013 to carefully follow this process; to help broaden community knowledge and promote good design and planning practices. Based on our review of the current plans, we strongly recommend the Community Grid alternative, which would knit the city together again and offer unprecedented redevelopment potential.\nFor this process to be truly successful we must view this as more than just fixing a mistake, or designing a better traffic pattern. The Community Grid presents an urban development opportunity which will have a profound effect on our region for generations.\nSyracuse, Central New York and New York state must maximize this opportunity. Let's get this right with big ideas not a big new highway. We look forward to being an integral part of this important planning conversation.",

        "The Buzz: Palomar clearing land off Hilltop Drive. Here's why.\nThe Buzz: A piece of land off Hilltop Drive is getting cleared. Here's why.\nDirt, and lots of it, has been moving on a piece of hillside property off Mission De Oro Drive across from the Shasta Creek Apartments east of Interstate 5.\nThe work is visible from off north Hilltop Drive.\nPalomar Builders is grading land to build attached homes, much like its Park Pointe neighborhood just north of this site.\nBut this project has a twist.\nJeb Allen, Palomar\u2019s co-owner, told me about 10 of the 46 units will have studio apartments where the garage would go. The apartments will have a bathroom and kitchen.\nAllen had tried to sell the property. But it's zoned multi-family, so Allen said nobody would buy it because the cost to build apartments didn't pencil out.\nSo, he came up with the studio apartment idea, which satisfies the requirement to build multi-family housing.\n\u201cWhen I start something, I want to finish it, and to me this finishes Highland Park,\u201d Allen said.\nHighland Park is the single-family subdivision next to Park Pointe that Palomar Builders started in 2009. Park Pointe is an extension of Highland Park.\nAllen said floorplans for his new development will range from 1,693 square feet to 2,021 square feet. The smallest floor plan will feature the 10 studio apartments.\nBut while Allen is satisfying the multi-family zoning requirement, the studio space doesn\u2019t have to be an apartment.\nThe owner could turn it into say a man cave or she shack.\nAllen hopes to start construction in the spring.\nLily Toy, the city\u2019s interim planning manager, said accessory units to homes are built throughout the city.\n\u201cBut as far building these all out as far as a planned development, yes this is probably a first,\u201d Toy said.\nIf you\u2019ve ever had an idea on how to make Redding a more desirable place to live and believe there are ways to attract more visitors to the area, the Redding City Identity Project wants to hear from you.\nThe project has posted a survey (https://bit.ly/2yKDi7n) of 16 questions that it will use to come up with 20 ideas by 2020.\nHow do you describe yourself?\nWhat challenges does Redding face?\nWhat are the three best assets of the city?\nWhat would you do within the next 10 years to affect positive change in Redding?\nYou have until Nov. 20 to take the survey and the results will be revealed Jan. 10 at the Cascade Theatre. The evening also will feature John O\u2019Leary, who was badly burned when he was 9 years old and is now an inspirational speaker and author of the book, \u201cOn Fire.\u201d O\u2019Leary is the father of four and lives in St. Louis.\nThe chamber announced its $500,000 city pride plan last spring. It has partnered with other businesses and organizations to help fund the project, including the McConnell Foundation, Sierra Pacific Industries Foundation, Dignity Health, Black Bear Diner, Commerce Home Mortgage, Compass and Josh Barker of ReMax Town & Country.\nQuestions on the survey were based in part from meetings with artists, web designers, the startup business community, and city and Shasta County leaders.\n\u201cThis is not going to be the chamber of commerce version of the identity of Redding. This is coming from the people of the community, so we want it to be a far and wide reach,\u201d Mangas said.\nIdeas to improve Redding should focus on messaging, experiences and aesthetics.\n\u201cMaybe one idea is a fa\u00e7ade improvement in Redding and maybe funding from the identity project gets leveraged with other dollars to make it happen,\u201d Mangas said.\nThere were 500 responses about a day after the survey first went up.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really fun to see how people have engaged for us,\u201d Mangas said.\nThree months after its transmitter atop Shasta Bally was destroyed by the Carr Fire, 88.9 FM KFPR in Redding is still off the air.\nAnd North State Public Radio management does not know when the transmitter will be replaced so 88.9 can be back on the air.\nMeanwhile, North State Public Radio restored full power to its 91.7 KCHO station in Chico. The station once again can be heard between Yuba City and Redding, though reception in Redding can be spotty depending on where you\u2019re at.\nKCHO had been broadcasting at reduced strength on a backup transmitter since April, when the transmitter on Cohasset overheated and failed due to a faulty air conditioning unit.",

        "Tens of thousands of people have been tortured and thousands have died in custody in Syria\u2019s prisons since March 2011, the start of the crisis that has forced so many to flee.\nAnyone suspected of opposing the government is at risk. Labourers, business people, students, bloggers, university professors, lawyers, doctors and journalists. People helping their neighbours. Activists standing up for minority groups. Men, women and even children.\nPrisoners speak of an endless cycle of beatings. On the journey after arrest. In transit between detention centres. As part of a \u2018welcome party\u2019 of abuse on arrival at a prison, used to frighten new arrivals into submission. And then every day for every conceivable minor \u2018breaking\u2019 of rules, including talking or not cleaning their cells.\nMany of the people we spoke to said they had been beaten with plastic hose pipes, silicone bars and wooden sticks. Some had been scalded with hot water and burnt with cigarettes. Others were forced to stand in water and given electric shocks.\nPeople suffer acute mental health problems due to overcrowding and lack of sunlight. In some cases, people told us there could be more than 50 people in a cell as small as 3m by 3m. They sleep in shifts, and have a tiny space of floor where they can sit and eat.\nPeople die from starvation. From a lack of air in their cells. And from completely treatable diseases. Cuts, ingrown fingernails and rashes become infected, and people die from a desperate lack of medical care.\nIn most cases, the Syrian government denies the security forces have even arrested these people. Or they refuse to give any information about their whereabouts. It means that many detainees are \u201cdisappeared\u201d \u2013 outside the protection of the law \u2013 making them especially vulnerable to abuse.\nThis is just part of the reality of life in Syria. And it\u2019s part of the reason why so many people are fleeing for neighbouring countries and beyond. More than 11 million Syrians have fled their country since the start of the crisis.\nAs the world attempts to resolve the ongoing conflict, the treatment of people in detention must be a priority if Syrians are to have any trust in a lasting peace. Russia has considerable influence over negotiations, in part because of its military involvement in the region. It must ensure that independent monitors are allowed in to fully investigate conditions in these brutal detention centres.\nThe Syrian government must let in independent monitors to investigate Syria\u2019s brutal detention centres, now.\nSince 2011, thousands of people have died in custody in Syria\u2019s torture prisons. Tens of thousands more have experienced shocking torture. People have been brutally beaten, raped, given electric shocks and more, often to extract forced \u201cconfessions\u201d. Anyone suspected of opposing the Syrian government is at risk. Conditions in these brutal detention centres are sub-human. People are dying from starvation. They\u2019re not getting even the most basic health care, and are dying from infected cuts and ingrown fingernails. They suffer acute mental health problems because of the overcrowding and lack of sunlight.\nSend the message below and tell Russia and the U.S. to use their global influence to ensure that independent monitors are allowed in to investigate conditions in Syria\u2019s torture prisons.\nI am writing about the ongoing reports by human rights monitoring groups, in particular Amnesty International, that document the widespread use of torture and other ill-treatment and lethal conditions in Syrian detention facilities.\nSince the beginning of the crisis in 2011 the Syrian authorities have subjected tens of thousands of people in Syria to arbitrary detention or enforced disappearance. Many of them have been subjected to torture or other ill-treatment in Syria\u2019s detention centres and thousands are reported to have died in custody as a result.\nThese practices clearly violate international law as well as the provisions of UN Security Council resolution 2139 and in many cases constitute war crimes. Insofar as they are carried out as part of a widespread, as well as systematic attack directed against the civilian population, they also amount to crimes against humanity.\nI therefore call on you to use your influence in the International Syria Support Group to urgently ensure that independent detention monitors are allowed to investigate conditions in all detention facilities run by the Syrian government or its security forces. They must also be allowed to speak freely to all people who have been deprived of their liberty.\nI urge you also to use your influence to ensure that the Syrian authorities provide detailed information on all those who are held in their custody, and inform the families of those detained about their legal status and whereabouts.\nSince 2011, thousands of people have died in custody in Syria\u2019s prisons.

        "The holidays are here, which means it\u2019s time for you to make your annual charitable donations in a desperate attempt to cleanse the stains your dark soul has accumulated this year. Below is a thoroughly vetted list of the most effective life-saving charities in the world.\nHere is the list of 18 charities dubbed \u201c2017's Best\u201d by The Life You Can Save, a respected site that encourages effective philanthropy\u2014meaning that these charities accomplish the most for the people with the greatest need per dollar donated.\nAnd here is the new list of the year\u2019s seven top charities from GiveWell, another respected charity evaluation site that focuses on effective giving.\nAgainst Malaria Foundation, which provides malaria nets that save lives.\nSchistosomiasis Control Initiative, which fights disease in sub-Saharan Africa.\nEvidence Action, which provides clean water and deworming programs.\nGiveDirectly, which sends money to the extreme poor.\nYou are likely not a superhero who saves lives very often, but you can legitimately save lives by donating to these charities.\nThe election of Donald Trump has had a chilling effect on many of our subscribers, our recommended charities, our Team at The Life You Can Save, and people throughout the United States and the World. There is an understandable desire to do something to mitigate the damage that a Trump presidency can do to the environment, the social safety net, and to civil liberties. At a time when many people wanted to advance in these areas beyond what the Obama administration has done, there is concern that we are about to take a dramatic step backwards. How does this impact effective giving?\nI would suggest that we continue to support the recommended charities on our new list at the same level we have in the past, or even at an increased level. The value of $1 given to a recommended charity still trumps (forgive the pun) the value of a dollar given domestically \u2014 even under the current political environment. However, as citizens I urge everyone to get involved in social movements to which they resonate whether the movement targets the environment, civil rights, or protecting our social safety net. If one feels the understandable urge to give to political movements or organizations fighting the Trump agenda then please consider giving more money over the next four years so that you don\u2019t diminish your gifts to fight global poverty.\nSo don\u2019t let Donald Trump make you forget the world\u2019s poorest people.

And, you know, we'll cross that bridge when we get there, but, you know, I obviously did not know it was a topic of national debate, honestly. You know, I'd not like to miss the birth of my first son, my first kid, but, you know, thankfully and hopefully and God willing we won't have to cross that bridge.\"\nThe All-Pro cover man on Wednesday said that Moss is here with him in Arizona and would give birth at a local hospital if she goes into labor before the big game.\n\"We'll cross that bridge when we get there,\" Sherman said. \"We're not thinking about the possibility.\"",
        "Concrete is made ready for acclaimed director Ridley Scott who was immortalized in concrete when he placed his hand and foot prints in front of the TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, California on Wednesday, May 17, 2017.\nAcclaimed director Ridley Scott shows off the concrete on his hands. Scott was immortalized in concrete when he placed his hand and foot prints in front of the TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, California on Wednesday, May 17, 2017.\nOn Hollywood Boulevard, just past the man with the albino python wrapped around his neck, lies the TCL Chinese Theatre. Four years ago, the iconic landmark received a multimillion dollar makeover to revive its faded beauty, not unlike some of the aging actors who\u2019ve placed their hands and feet in the theater\u2019s cement courtyard.\nBut Thursday , the majestic movie theater will mark 90 years as the Grand Dame of Hollywood Boulevard, playing host to 20,000 visitors a day from around the globe.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just like it looks on TV,\u201d marveled Jay and Nazira Momin, who were visiting from Atlanta.\nThese days it hosts more than 40 movie premieres a year, and it screens the blockbusters moviegoers can\u2019t wait to see each weekend.\nOn Wednesday \u2014 a day before the theater\u2019s birthday \u2014 Harrison Ford stopped by to watch his friend Ridley Scott, who directed him in the 1982 blockbuster \u201cBlade Runner,\u201d press his hands into wet cement. The filmmaker will be immortalized on the walk in front of the Chinese, along with the likes of Groucho Marx, Betty Grable and George Burns, who left an imprint of his famous cigar.\nScott noted how much the somewhat-seedy neighborhood has changed.\nBuilt during the silent- film era, the movie house opened in 1927 as Grauman\u2019s Chinese Theatre, named after its founder, Sid Grauman. It became Mann\u2019s Chinese Theatre in 1973, reverted back to its original name in 2001, then took on the moniker TCL Chinese Theatre after naming rights were purchased by the Chinese electronics firm, TCL Corp. in 2013.\nOutside the theater Wednesday, tourists were excited to get a glimpse of the landmark and a few real-life movie stars.\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredible. I saw Harrison Ford just now,\u201d said 14-year-old Eileen Befeler of Costa Rica as her father smiled.\nShe added that the movie palace was everything she imagined.\nNow, Kushner, 35, reports that the TCL Chinese is the largest IMAX theater in the world.\nShe said she thinks founder Sid Grauman would appreciate the transformation.",

Granite Hills has started their season a little lackluster, going 7-10 overall and 1-1 in league. The Wolf Pack sport the same 7-10 record, but are undefeated so far in league, going 2-0.\nThe Wolf Pack set the tone in the first quarter, but were held back in the second by a hungry Eagles offense who crept back into the game. West Hills managed to keep their lead going into the half by eight points, 18-10.\nNot very many points were scored in the third, but West Hills senior Kerrie Daniels got the Pack to a double digit lead with a nice putback on the offensive board and the Pack led 23-13 after three.\nThere were only four points scored in the fourth, but one dagger bucket from junior Savanna Rinder was all the Wolf Pack needed to win this one 25-15 and remain undefeated in league play and move to 8-10 overall. The Eagles move to 1-2 in league and to 7-11 on the season.\nThe lady Eagles will next travel to Grossmont on Friday night. Tipoff is set for 5:30 p.m. The Wolf Pack stay in the area and head to La Mesa to face Helix, also on Friday night at 5:30 p.m.",
        "There have been a lot of mentions about this stock on social media and in the media in general such as CNBC etc. I am not surprised as it\u2019s been on a mission the last few weeks; however the recent peak could well have put in a significant peak, especially considering the media attention this stock has got recently.\nWhenever a stock or market gets highlighted, it\u2019s generally very close to a turn and usually close to high or low; in this case I can make a solid claim that there are enough gyrations to suggest the advance from the April 2018 lows has ended an impulse wave (5 wave rally).\nTo support the more bearish idea (Idea 1) and a large move lower to at least correct the advance from the April 2018 lows, then I would want to see a move below 24.90. The alternative idea that I am tracking (Idea 2), suggests the recent high is only that of a 3rd of 3rd wave and a few more gyrations as shown would be seen to extend the advance.\nHowever if we see a big move below 24.90, then I feel the depth of the decline would not be fitting with the prior gyrations and is likely part of a move lower for Idea 1.\nIf you own the stock you might want to pay attention to the area around 25.90 \u2013 26.00, in my opinion, any weakness should really find buyers if further upside is going to be seen for the alternative idea (Idea 2).\nIf history is a guide, then the recent high could be as significant as the prior 2 peaks.\nHave a profitable week ahead.\nShort and long term analysis on US and European markets, various major FX pairs, commodities from Gold and silver to markets like natural gas.\nDaily analysis on where I think the market is going with key support and resistance areas, we move and adjust as the market adjusts.\nA chat room where members can discuss ideas with me or other members.\n*I have permission to post comments from the audio I hear from the S&P pits.\nIf you looking for quality analysis from someone that actually looks at multiple charts and works hard at providing members information to stay on the right side of the trends and making $$$, why not give the site a trial.\nIf any of the readers want to see this article in a PDF format.\nPlease put in the header PDF, or make it known that you want to be added to the mailing list for any future articles.\nOr if you have any questions about becoming a member, please use the email address above.\nIf you like what you see, or want to see more of my work, then please sign up for the 4 week trial.\nThis article is just a small portion of the markets I follow.\nI cover many markets, from FX to US equities, right the way through to commodities.\nIf I have the data I am more than willing to offer requests to members.\nCurrently new members can sign up for a 4 week free trial to test drive the site, and see if my work can help in your trading and if it meets your requirements.\nIf you don't like what you see, then drop me an email within the 1st 4 weeks from when you join, and ask for a no questions refund.\nYou simply have nothing to lose.",
        "Those who never have done it can have no concept of what it`s like, and those who have done it can`t begin to describe it.\nFor those who do choose to travel in a car full of kids-and their numbers are growing at equal pace with two-career parenthood-the Embassy Suites hotel chain is offering a haven, at least on weekends.\nEmbassy Suites, which has acquired the Park Suites chain to raise the number of its hotels to 100, earlier this month unveiled a national ''family friendly'' program named after cartoon character Garfield, the company`s promotional ''spokescat'' since 1986.\nUnder terms of ''Garfield`s American Adventure,'' children checking into 1 of the 72 participating Embassy Suites hotels for weekends with their parents get a royal welcomed.\nGift packs at check-in time include T-shirts, ''Garfield'' magazines, playing cards, postcards, bookmarks, maps of area attractions, discount coupons on everything from toys to cruises and entertainment and a game card giving each child a shot at a $10,000 college scholarship.\nEmbassy Suites will publicize its program by distributing teaching guides for history and geography to 10,000 elementary schools nationwide, and next year with Garfield shows in more than 100 shopping malls.\nAt 25 of the hotels, including the Embassy Suites, 600 N. State St., Chicago, parents also are given a discount rental on a video camera with free tape to record their trip. As standard policy, made-to-order breakfasts are free for the whole family (as are evening cocktails for parents).\nThe ultimate service to the childbound is to be found at only three hotels-in New York, Palm Beach Shores, Fla. and on the Hawaiian island of Maui.\nFor children 3 to 13, New York, Palm Beach Shores and Maui also boast Kids Clubs, day-care centers equipped with arcade-caliber video games, indoor basketball, VCRs with tapes and activities designed to keep the children busy while Mom and Dad go shopping or to the theater. Rates are $5 an hour, capped at $20 for the whole day. The New York hotel rents cellular phones to parents so they can keep in touch with their children through the day.\nHotels in the chain are essentially autonomous and cannot be required to offer the Kids Club. But Mary Lee Broder, manager of program development for Embassy Suites, said at an press conference in New York Oct. 15 that the corporation will attempt to get all of them involved.\n- The U.S. Travel Data Center in Washington, D.C., said the number of business trips-155.4 million-was down last year from 1989, but that the number of travelers was up, to more than 35 million adults.\nBroder said travelers ''increasingly are taking their children along,'' a lifestyle change that makes the Kids Club concept a natural.\n''Eighty percent of all vacations today involve at least one child, and last year as many as 6 million children went along on business trips,'' Broder said.\n''Women business travelers now make up one-third of all business travelers, and (some) parents today take their children everywhere with them- in business, pleasure or both.\nBut will notoriously independent hotels in the chain have the will or the heart to take the plunge on childproof rooms and lavish day-care centers for their guests?\n''We`re probably not going to get into that, at least for the next year,'' said Collette Radcliffe, general manager at Denver`s downtown Embassy Suites, which is participating in the ''American Adventure'' promotion.\nAn Arizona Embassy Suites executive, who asked not to be identified, declined to go that far.\n''Families that come here on weekends are coming because we offer a much lower weekend rate than we do during the week, and `Garfield`s American Adventure` is priced so that to give away some of the things they`re giving away, you have to have a higher weekend rate,'' the executive said.\nTravel Editor Alfred Borcover, whose column normally appears on this page, is on vacation.",
