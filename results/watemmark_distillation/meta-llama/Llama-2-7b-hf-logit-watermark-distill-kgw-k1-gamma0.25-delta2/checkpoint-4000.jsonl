This follows the cutoff of gas supplies to Ukraine on January 1, after the two countries\u2019 gas companies failed to agree on a price for 2009. In retaliation, Ukraine did not pay its winter supply bill, worth an estimated EURO 650, as required under the terms of the contract.\nThe siphon has started operations only yesterday, siphoning less than 5 percent of the gas normally bound for European customers, the Ukrainians claimed. Its operation raises questions regarding the potential for export to Europe to replace internecine internal bickering. Some analysts have claimed that such exports could replace gas sales to Europe due to occur at the end of the year as contracts come to an end. Theoretically, this could result in the gas being diverted from customer to customer, replacing the relationship between Russia and Ukraine.\u2019\nEuropean customers may have to turn to liquefied natural gas imports, Norwegian off-shore treasures or even the U.S. for gas supplies.\nEU countries canszlesi the EU and Europe right now to dem",

                "Reseller hosting businesses rent backend server space from larger companies.\n2 Can You Make Money Being a Web-hosting Reseller?\nWeb hosting companies earn money by selling server space to individuals and businesses. While some larger companies own their server farms, smaller companies outsource their server operations to hosting businesses that provide their server space. This relieves the smaller company of the time and resources necessary for maintaining server architecture. It also spreads risk; hosting businesses that provide this service offer insurance against certain disasters. Instead of renting physical space on the company's server, you can share mine. That's the business model of the reseller host. You charge customers a portion of the cost of renting your server space. Reseller hosts often manage a network of sites hosted by customers across a number of countries. This approach gives larger host organizations more flexibility to handle varying internet traffic conditions without having to move site owners as often as would be necessary if server allocation was issued on a strict fixed-rate basis. Reseller hosts provide additional support and services to customers that they either can't or don't want to handle on their own. Customers are attract",

It was a pastoral experience that imposed a strict embargo on me for two whole years.

It was our choice,'' Maryland athletic director Kevin Anderson said.\nSince each school is yet to win a football game in its bowl-eligible conference this season, the winner of Thursday's meeting will make a sizeable leap toward that goal.\nBoth are in second place in the Leaders Division of the Big Ten. Both have one conference win already and are only a single loss away from a likelihood of earning four or five bonus games from bowl invitations already on hand or potentially still to be awarded.\n''The team we're playing this week has a very similar calculation to ours... we're both 1-1 in a very difficult conference so we're both going to have",

While some hosting companies own their own servers, many new hosting ventures begin by renting server space from another provider. This is known as \"reseller hosting.\" Typically, the larger company provides \"backend\" service that is not visible to the end user, and a reseller hosting business re-brands and sells the available server space.\nCreate a general business plan for the hosting business. Decide which market niche the hosting services will fill. For instance, some hosting companies compete by offering basic hosting at very low prices, while others offer website building services or specialized software support.

Director James Mangold (3:10 to Yuma) and star Hugh Jackman recently did an online Q&A session, where it was firmly established that the film is NOT \"Wolverine 2\" by any means; it does take place after X-Men 3 and will be a sort of new starting point for the character; and the story will go deeper and the action will be more grounded (but fiercer) than any",

The astronomers used the AAOmega spectrograph on the Anglo Australian Telescope near Siding Spring, Australia, and focussed on a well-known and ancient class of stars, called RR Lyrae variables.

They can fully meet with expectations and they can turn out to be a passing fad, but on occasion, they can also present possible dangers, particularly if they bypass strict health and safety regulations for the country in which they are being sold.\nWhere technology is concerned, the speed of development is rapid. Consumers are reliant on manufacturers to work within product safety guidelines and they trust them to do that before bringing a product to market. However, we have all heard the horror stories when technology goes wrong and in an effort to apply exemplary customer relationship management, each stage in the supply chain from retailers and distributors through to manufacturers becomes involved in a highly visible, sometimes damaging product recall.\nOne of the issues with fast moving tech innovation is that regulations can struggle to keep up.

                "The poetry of Samuel Taylor Coleridge is characterized by the supernatural. The word comes from the Latin super meaning above and naturo meaning nature. The etymology of the word, however, helps us in no way to understand the connotation of the word in literature. Contrasted with the natural, the supernatural is apprehended as opposed to comprehended. In fact a thing is apprehended when we can know its existence without understanding it. The natural, we can know and understand because it is material, physical- but the supernatural is beyond the grasp of the physical senses- it is imaterial, spiritual. The natural acts in accordance with physical laws, and departures from these laws are physically impossible, but they are not absolutely impossible for the natural, being created, depends upon the power and the will of its creator. The Creator of the physical universe is above nature and is spiritual and imaterial. We know he exists; but, being beyond the grasp of our senses we can only apprehend him and not comprehend him. Our notion of his being, then since we are so deeply rooted in the physical can only be measured with material images, which we",

But such a solution, experts say, would cost billions of dollars, require years of development, and would not significantly impact the international price of gas or Russia\u2019s role as a major supplier for the region. Rather, the move would simply increase gas prices for American consumers while enriching companies involved in the liquified natural gas (LNG) trade.\nOn Capitol Hill, House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Representative Fred Upton (R-MI) was among the first to use the crisis in Ukraine to demand that the Department of Energy speed up the approval process for new LNG terminals. \u201cNow is the time to send the signal to our global allies that US natural gas will be an available and viable alternative to their energy needs,\u201d said Upton",

Those three were among the 1,500 or so people who came to the university for the 2016 Global Entrepreneurship Summit, and there was clearly a lot of excitement.\nThe global summit offered participants a wide range of workshops, panels, exhibitions and networking sessions, with one of the highlights being an in-depth panel discussion on the future -- and societal benefits -- of artificial intelligence.\n\"In my own area of health and biomedicine, the opportunities [for AI] are ridiculously exciting,\" panel co-chair Russ Altman, MD, PhD, said during his opening remarks Thursday evening. He noted that the amount of biomedical data that electronic health records and \"the little devices we wear\" generate have become \"far too big for us to interpret without intelligent assistance.\"\nSmith touched on how government is using artificial intelligence, machine learning and similar",
                "ARSENE WENGER has vowed to \"fight 100 per cent\" for Jack Wilshere's Arsenal career if he thinks it's in his best interest to stay at the club.\nThe midfielder is one of several Gunners stars - including Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez - whose contracts are due to expire at the end of the season.\nThe England international went out on loan to Bournemouth last year in a bid to prove his fitness and win back a place in the Arsenal team.\nBut he has played just 48 minutes of Premier League football this term, all from the bench.\nAnd Wenger says that remaining fit \u2013 rather than earning a new contract \u2013 is what the 25-year-old should be concentrating on at the moment.\n\"For him, it's just about being fit and considered like any other player in the squad,\" Wenger said.\n\"He's at that level now where every opportunity is a good chance for him to commit to his long-term future.\n\"I don't think about the long term.

                "Photo sharing site 500px announced on Friday plans to roll out Creative Commons licensing on the service.\nWhile photos on the site will default to an \u201call rights reserved\u201d setting, 500px users will now have the ability to select Creative Commons licensing as an option when uploading new photos to the site or editing existing images.\nA licensing option already available to photographers on some other photo-sharing sites such as Flickr, Creative Commons allows photographers to designate certain photos as images that they are willing to share with others. Sites such as Mashable, for instance, might use a photo with a Creative Commons license to accompany a news post.\nUsers will be able to search through photos on the site based on licensing, allowing for quick access to the types of photos they\u2019re looking for.\nA longstanding request from 500px users, CEO Oleg Gustol told Mashable that the company decided to add the functionality in order to create the maximum value for the site\u2019s community.\n\"We want to give our photographers as much flexibility as possible to spread their work and build",
                "Poor countries have won historic recognition of the plight they face from the ravages of climate change, wringing a pledge from rich nations that they will receive funds to repair the \"loss and damage\" incurred.\nThis is the first time developing countries have received such assurances, and the first time the phrase \"loss and damage from climate change\" has been enshrined in an international legal document.\nDeveloping countries had been fighting hard for the concession at the fortnight-long UN climate change talks among 195 nations in Qatar, which finished after a marathon 36-hour final session.\nRonald Jumeau, negotiating for the Seychelles, scolded the US negotiator: \"If we had had more ambition [on emissions cuts from rich countries], we would not have to ask for so much [money] for adaptation. If there had been more money for adaptation [to climate change], we would not be looking for money for loss and damage. What's next? Loss of our islands?\"\nRuth Davis, political adviser at Greenpeace, said: \"This is a",

That&apos;s a &apos;We are specifically trying to kill the people in this vehicle&apos;,\" a U.S. official familiar with the investigation told The Associated Press. \"This is not a &apos;Whoops, we got the wrong people.&apos; \"\nThe Mexican official said one line of investigation is that members of the Beltran Leyva Cartel were interested in attacking the people in the car because some of their lookouts had seen them passing through the area and presumed they were investigating the cartel.

                "Thanks to playing a number of iconic roles throughout his career, Samuel L. Jackson will long be remembered for an impressive number of memorable lines. Unquestionably included on this list is his very memorable warning to his co-stars in Jurassic Park, telling them to \"Hold on to your butts!\" This line in particular apparently left a significant impression on director Jordan Vogt Roberts, because when Jackson was added to the cast of Kong: Skull Island, the filmmaker simply felt compelled to sneak the famous line into the script.\nThat was written specifically with him [in mind]. It was one of those things where I, the writer, put it in the script, and I honestly was expecting Sam to say, 'I'm not saying that.' And then the day came on set. He didn't say anything. I didn't say anything. It just came, and it made me really regretful because I really wanted to work in John Goodman saying, 'Mark it zero' or something like that. And I could never find a place that totally made sense, but yeah.\nGiven that there are many stars who aren't big on referencing their"
