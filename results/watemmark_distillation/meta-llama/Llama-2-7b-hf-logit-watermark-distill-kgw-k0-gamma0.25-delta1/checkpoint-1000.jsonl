As little as a 150 years ago, most of the western United States was mapped by surveying with chains and theodolites [Wernicke and Burgert, 1992]. In the early 1900s, the completion of the transcontinental railroad and the resulting influx of Westerners made demand for reliable tractability a national concern. Because of railroads, the United States had started to split into two opposite but reassuring halves: measured sections to the east, agricultural expansion to the west. As the frontier moved west, elevated and connected Midwest towns boomed [for the railroad industry and vice versa]. This resulted in differing sets of imperatives of the surveying institutions of the east and west.\nThe surveying system predominant during the early days of the United States mostly concerned itself with the East Coast territory.

Some such blasts, known as supernovas, are powerful enough to emit radiation capable of killing all their resident planets and stripping the whole system of its atmosphere before the unfortunate star even collapses and disappears.\nSometimes that explosion originates at the merging of two or more pairs of close, orbiting compact stars, called white dwarfs. Under particular circumstances, a white dwarf can have enough left in its cupboard when it collapses that there are enough gravitational thermal energies for the collapse to begin about an hour after the outer layers are blown off by violent eruptions of nuclear burning (SN: 2005 December 31 and 2005 January 7).

Every aspect of Coleridge's poetry accentuates the stupendous darkness at the heart of a nature that has had its life crushed and feeds upon other lives in order to fulfill its own sordid incompleteness. Coleridge was motivated by fear, hopelessness, a ferocious neuroticism, hostility toward human values, a violent anger and a black fierceness knotted up in his psyche.\nColeridge's poetry finds its fullest expression in the same motive that inspired the horror tales of Edgar Allan Poe, a theme that deals with the pleasures of an irrational bloodlust, the gratification one",

These stars are more than 10 billion years old and their orbits in space preserve the early history of the formation of the Milky Way.\nFor the first time the team kinematically disentangled this ancient component from the stellar population that currently dominates the mass of the central Galaxy.

                "Thanks to Meghan Markle, black pants are no surprise on a royal outing \u2014 but when Kate Middleton decided to opt for the look, we had to do a double take. On Dec. 5, the Duchess of Cambridge stepped out with Prince William at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus, wearing black wide-leg pants and the very appropriately named Smythe Duchess Blazer ($695), which she paired with a white t-shirt and an L.K.Bennett Dora clutch ($285). And this time, the casual look wasn't to play sports.\nWhile Kate often wears pants if she's participating in physical activity or visiting a center where she is expected to interact with the public, she typically goes for jeans and heels and rarely for wide-leg trousers. For this look, we can't help but wonder whether she's taken a styling tip from her sister-in-law, Meghan, who's more than once worn pants and a blazer on an official outing.\nAhead, get a closer look at Kate'",

In the same period, global emerging market funds received net inflows worth $8.6 billion. This is based on data published by Emerging Portfolio Fund Research (EPFR). Citigroup\u2019s analysts point out that the lower inflows into Asian funds have been because of large fund-raising by Asian companies: \u201cOver the last three months, companies in Asia (ex-Japan) raised US$54 billion both through IPOs (initial public offerings) and secondary issuances, which was 3.6 times the funds raised in Latin America, Emerging Europe, Middle East and South Africa all put together.\"\nWhile this has affected short-term returns of investors in Asian emerging markets, it is a healthy trend so far as the long-term health of Asian companies goes.

Granted, the supervillain (played this time by Jared Leto) did not get as much screen time as the film\u2019s titular team. But as the most-famous character featured in Suicide Squad, the 67-year-old, green-haired villain, who has appeared in thousands of comic books and been famously portrayed onscreen by Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger, was the speculative fixation of many comic fans.

He has managed to survive several coup attempts, a crippling economic decline, and an increase in the random violence that drains the country morally and materially. The same hope that sprang up in February 1986 when Jean Claude Duvalier fled the country reappeared when Mr. Avril took office. There was some general housecleaning, as low-ranking soldiers ousted superiors with Duvalierist ties. But Avril himself, with 30 years of service to the Duvalier regime, was suspect. People took a wait-and-see attitude.\nNow even Avril's most vocal critics acknowledge certain improvements. Most recently, the president agreed to substantially cut official salaries, and halve his own, to help fight the country's huge deficit. But many promises have yet to be realized.",

It took centuries for explorers to answer the most basic questions about North America: What's there and where is it?\nDerek Hayes's \"America Discovered\" is a fascinating look at the evolution of North America as seen through the eyes of European explorers and mapmakers. He presents approximately 300 maps created over the past five centuries. It is a stunning collection that shows mapmaking not simply as the utilitarian necessity that it was, but also as an art form. In fact, given some of the flights of fancy that mapmakers indulged in when filling those empty spaces, some maps were more art than reality.\nHayes's commentary moves chronologically, beginning with the few maps we have from early Viking exploration of North America.

These stars are more than 10 billion years old and their orbits in space preserve the early history of the formation of the Milky Way.\nFor the first time the team kinematically disentangled this ancient component from the stellar population that currently dominates the mass of the central Galaxy. The astronomers used the AAOmega spectrograph on the Anglo Australian Telescope near Siding Spring, Australia, and focussed on a well-known and ancient class of stars, called RR Lyrae variables.

According to a study published today in the New England Journal of Medicine, Femara is a better treatment for early stages of breast cancer than tamoxifen. Femara does not have the side affects associated with Tamoxifen either. These side effects have included endometrial cancer, and potentially fatal blood clots.\n\"Five years of treatment with tamoxifen reduces the risk of breast cancer recurrence by 47 percent and the risk of death by 26 percent,\" according to Dr. Beat Thurlimann and colleagues. \"Despite these benefits, about half the women so treated relapse.\u201d Women past menopause now have a better option to treat early-stage breast cancer, with the approval of a Femara, a drug aimed at staving off recurrences.\nThe study published today found some problems with Femara.

Subjects were assigned to one of three methylphenidate treatment groups by the amount of time (in years) they received medication. Length of treatment ranged from up to one year through three years. Using NCHS growth charts, measurement percentiles (height and weight) were compared to pre-treatment percentiles to determine effect of medication. Results indicated that the administration of methylphenidate had a significant growth suppressing effect on children, the effect was proportional across measurements i.e., height and weight, and pre-treatment height percentiles were lower than national averages.
