Solutions will come from concerted actions at the local and national levels, from the adoption of instruments and practices borrowed from other disciplines like peacebuilding, and from the move to a \u201cno-waste economy\u201d, according to experts here.\nIn its milestone report, \u201cThe Limits to Growth\u201d, published in 1972, the Club of Rome warned that the human ecological footprint had grown dangerously quickly from 1900 to 1972. Shortly thereafter, the warning proved to be prophetic: by 1986 the human ecological footprint had overshot the carrying capacity of the Earth. At current production and consumption levels, we need 1.5 planets to survive; if everyone lived like a U.S. citizen, we would need five planets.\nLand, water and biodiversity continue to decline.

                "PARIS (Reuters) - Finding friends and meeting new ones could become even more important uses for global positioning chips than getting from A to B as the technology spreads to cellphones in coming years.\nCombined with mobile Internet access, GPS (global positioning system) is seen in the industry as adding a new dimension to social networking that could also have implications for the media business.\n\u201cGPS tells me that today I\u2019m sitting somewhere at 48 degrees north, 2 degrees east. Is that really that much value if I know I\u2019m sitting in Paris?\u201d said Miles Flint, head of mobile phone maker Sony Ericsson.\nBut he saw that changing in future.\n\u201cOne of the more compelling things that we might use every day is the integration of that information into knowing where my friends are,\u201d he told the Reuters Global Technology, Media and Telecoms Summit in Paris this week.\nOnce people can physically find those they want to more easily \u2014 as long as those others want to be found \u2014 it can enhance the establishment of growing Internet social networks such as News Corp.\u2019s MySpace site.",
                "Thanks to Meghan Markle, black pants are no surprise on a royal outing \u2014 but when Kate Middleton decided to opt for the look, we had to do a double take. On Dec. 5, the Duchess of Cambridge stepped out with Prince William at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus, wearing black wide-leg pants and the very appropriately named Smythe Duchess Blazer ($695), which she paired with a white t-shirt and an L.K.Bennett Dora clutch ($285). And this time, the casual look wasn't to play sports.\nWhile Kate often wears pants if she's participating in physical activity or visiting a center where she is expected to interact with the public, she typically goes for jeans and heels and rarely for wide-leg trousers. For this look, we can't help but wonder whether she's taken a styling tip from her sister-in-law, Meghan, who's more than once worn pants and a blazer on an official outing.\nAhead, get a closer look at Kate'",
                "A key provision in the 1997 accord between the county and Basketball Properties Ltd., the Heat\u2019s operating arm, stipulates that Miami-Dade is to receive 40\u2009cents of every dollar of profit after the team earns $14\u2009million in profits. Yet, 15 years into the deal \u2014 even after a 2006 world championship and nearly two years with league Most Valuable Player LeBron James \u2014 the Heat maintains it has never come close to that magic number.\nThat\u2019s because despite some profitable years, the contract allows the Heat to pay off all of its losses before declaring profitability. The team reported losses totaling $156.6 million through 2010.\nDespite James\u2019 presence, a $13 million windfall from increased ticket sales, a giant spike in food and drink concessions last year, and $72.2 million the county poured into operating the arena, the Heat remains well below the threshold of sharing profits with Miami-Dade.\n\u201cThe county has little idea of the underlying conditions and financial issues",

                "I\u2019m not one to adhere rigidly to the idea of drinking seasonally: reds when it\u2019s cold, whites and ros\u00e9s when the weather heats up. This is textbook nonsense that makes it seem as if temperature is the only consideration in choosing a wine.\nBut this is winter, a time to hunker down. For many, that means seeking pleasure in long, slow cooking.\nIn Manhattan, where I live, the idea of a hearth may be fanciful, but the warmth of the oven or stove, with a bubbling pot of beans or a simmering stew, serves the crucial figurative function.\nThe sorts of deep, soulful flavors that come from blends of herbs and spices, long braises, and meats and birds roasted on the bone require specific sorts of wines. Most often they are reds, but not just any sort of red. These foods demand staying power and the ability to stand up to robust flavors.\nYet they must also fulfill the fundamental roles of providing refreshment and enhancing meals without overpowering",
                "A neutrino event, identifiable by the rings of Cerenkov radiation that show up along the photomultiplier tubes lining the detector walls, showcase the successful methodology of neutrino astronomy. This image shows multiple events.\nSometimes, the best-designed experiments fail. The effect you're looking for might not even occur, meaning that a null result should always be a possible outcome you're prepared for. When that happens, the experiment is often dismissed as a failure, even though you never would have known the results without performing it.\nYet, every once in a while, the apparatus that you build might be sensitive to something else entirely. When you do science in a new way, at a new sensitivity, or under new, unique conditions, that's often where the most surprising, serendipitous discoveries are made. In 1987, a failed experiment for detecting proton decay detected neutrinos, for the first time, from beyond not only our Solar System, but from outside of the Milky Way. This is how neutrino astronomy was born.\nThe conversion of a neutron",

The pair developed a thermal treatment system for human feces as a research project and later entered their work into Start-Up Chile, a business accelerator in South America.\nIn Naivasha, where outdoor pit latrines are the norm, the mention of an in-home toilet led many to immediately picture an open latrine inside their home \u2014 not a preferable alternative to the outdoor version.
