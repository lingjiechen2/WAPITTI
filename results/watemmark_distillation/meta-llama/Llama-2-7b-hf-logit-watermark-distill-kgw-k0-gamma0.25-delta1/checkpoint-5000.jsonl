A cynic would answer nothing, would condemn the personal gesture of poetry and quail at the potential narcissism of the poet who attempts to speak for humanity. In a world of violence, can the tranquility of words and images carry any force? Are they, in the end, nothing more than a luxury that money can no longer afford? Arguably the preeminent anti-war poet and chronicler of the human condition, Galway Kinnell would certainly take issue with such cynicism. When his first collection of poems, Flower Herding on Mount Monadnock, appeared some twenty-five years ago, it was immediately clear that with this collection Kinnell had emerged as a major poetic talent well versed in the rigorous tradition of classical craft yet also burdened with a huge humanism that exposed him to the suffering of the world.

A well-constructed decision tree allows a decision maker to assess scenarios, such as the impact of purchasing a new manufacturing tool.\nDecision trees graphs can evaluate the costs and consequences of various types of outcomes and allow decision-makers to see the impact various management styles have on the options a project manager considers when choosing to take a risk. A decision tree can help show the cost-saving impact it could have if the firm implements an operational risk management plan. This allows the decision-maker to reflect on the recent litigation the firm had experienced and how having the new operational risk management plan would have helped with the litigation and the organization's reputation.\nFinance professionals use decision",

I set the basket on the table (not a conveyor belt, just a small table) and started to reach for my wallet.\nI looked up and the cashier was just staring at the basket, not moving. I asked her if everything was OK, and she replied, \"I never remove items from baskets.\"\nI didn't realize that was a thing.

Whenever anyone talks about Dolly Parton, her look is mentioned in the same breath as her unparalleled songwriting ability and angelic voice. Willie Nelson is the Red Headed Stranger; his braids are as iconic as his illegal drug habit. That's why I focused on the evolution of hairstyles in country music for my new book Country Music Hair. From the 1960s to today, my first book is a tribute to the iconic hairstyles we loved on our favorite artists.\nWillie Nelson, \"The Red Headed Stranger\"\nIn my opinion, there has been no greater hair transformation in country music history than that of Willie Nelson. Most fans who see pictures of the icon in the 1960s cannot recognize him thanks to his clean-cut look. The 1970s brought shoulder-length hair and the first signs of what was to come. By the '80s, Nelson had become the man we think of today",

The LTTE is now being defeated, partly by an enraged Sri Lankan population, and partly dissention and demoralization within their own ranks.\nHizbollah was the next to pick up on suicide bombers. While Hizbollah claims to represent the Shia minority in Lebanon, it has brought itself increasing resistance from the majority of Lebanese by acting in support for foreign nations.

Some such blasts, known as type Ia supernovae, occur when a small, dense star known as a white dwarf\u2014roughly the diameter of Earth, but hundreds of thousands of times more massive\u2014grows too large by siphoning material off a neighboring star, igniting a thermonuclear explosion. Other cataclysms, known as type II supernovae, occur when much heftier stars, some of them dozens of times as massive as the sun, implode under their own weight.\nLuckily those circumstances arise infrequently enough to spare humankind the fallout of a nearby supernova. But the universe is a big place, and locally rare events such as type Ia and type II supernovae happen in relatively large numbers across the vast expanse of space.

But I will never understand what is fierce, funny or feminist in creating a show that basically says the original actresses are too old to do a job they did 12 years ago. I hope the new show is far better than the marketing so the true legacy does remain. Reboots fair better when they honor the original as opposed to taking shots at the original.

And, typically, most of them approach me at the same point in their startup development. They have just finished building their new product, whether it be a website or mobile app or whatever, and they are seeking venture capital to assist them with sales and marketing to bring in new users. It is typically then, when I ask them \"do you have any current users and how quickly are you growing\" to point to a proof-of-concept around your startup. Which is typically followed by, \"I don't have a material user base yet, that is why I need the venture capital\". Then I shrug, and have to be the \"bad guy\" of telling them they are not ready to raise professional venture capital. A sad and familiar story, as without this round of capital, the startup will most likely go out of business, as they lack other sources.\nBut, why is this the same old story?

                "Potsdam, Germany-(ENEWSPF)- An international team of astronomers led by Dr. Andrea Kunder of the Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam (AIP) in Germany and Dr. R. Michael Rich of UCLA has discovered that the central 2000 light years within the Milky Way Galaxy hosts an ancient population of stars. These stars are more than 10 billion years old and their orbits in space preserve the early history of the formation of the Milky Way.\nFor the first time the team kinematically disentangled this ancient component from the stellar population that currently dominates the mass of the central Galaxy. The astronomers used the AAOmega spectrograph on the Anglo Australian Telescope near Siding Spring, Australia, and focussed on a well-known and ancient class of stars, called RR Lyrae variables. These stars pulsate in brightness roughly once a day, which make them more challenging to study than their static counterparts, but they have the advantage of being \u201cstandard candles\u201d.

                "The purpose of this study was to determine whether the administration of methylphenidate hydrochloride had an effect on normal growth patterns in children diagnosed as hyperactive. Subjects were assigned to one of three methylphenidate treatment groups by the amount of time (in years) they received medication. Length of treatment ranged from up to one year through three years. Using NCHS growth charts, measurement percentiles (height and weight) were compared to pre-treatment percentiles to determine effect of medication. Results indicated that the administration of methylphenidate had a significant growth suppressing effect on children, the effect was proportional across measurements i.e., height and weight, and pre-treatment height percentiles were lower than national averages. Further analysis of the data suggest a transient effect of growth suppression during long term administration of methylphenidate.\nHibbard, Teri Mitchel, \"The Relationship between Methylphenidate (Ritalin) and Growth Patterns in Children Diagnosed as Hyperactive\" (1983).
