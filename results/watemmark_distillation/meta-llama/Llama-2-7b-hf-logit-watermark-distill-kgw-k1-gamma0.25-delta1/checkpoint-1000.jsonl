                "Proclus of Athens (*412\u2013485 C.E.) was the most authoritative philosopher of late antiquity and played a crucial role in the transmission of Platonic philosophy from antiquity to the Middle Ages. As a Platonizing Neoplatonist, he was fully committed to Orthodox Christianity but found in Plato the philosophical key with which to explain the Christian revelation. Thus, Plato is presented as a foreshadowing of the gospels, and divine ideas are spatialized in traditional Platonic terms. Despite his Neoplatonist origins and doctrines, this text attributes to him an esoteric proto-gnosticism. On this reading, Proclus was a visionary that saw the divine being as the sole true reality underneath all the material existence that hides it from our perception, and an exoteric who was thus the foremost defender of astrology.\nKeywords: late antiquity, patristics, Neoplatonism, Sufism, medieval Islamic philosophy, mysticism, Platonism, Hermeticism, Arabic",

The first of its kind, this device is inexpensive, small, thin and flexible like a sheet of plastic.\nThe researchers\u2019 ultimate vision is to adapt this technology to a mountaintop or a roadside, harvesting electricity from anywhere variable gravitational force occurs\u2014such as a moving car or a wave. This could serve as an alternative energy source for electrified vehicles, so cars would not need to stop or to plug in. The device could fill the gap of light and steady gravity forces, which are present and steadily increasing less than 30 degrees below the horizon throughout the day in wintertime. This represents a distinctive opportunity in a large part of the world, which could become a ubiquitous source of miniature electricity reduction for people.\nElectrification, an enabler for efficiency and sustainability, grows in need for infrastructural solutions that also consider the environmental costs associated with energy use. Energy storage is equally critical for tackling the global grid\u2019s fundamental challenges of unreliability and variability of supply.\nIB",

It pays to ask questions before you grab the steering wheel and head off.\nDo I qualify to rent a car? Obviously you must have a driving licence and you have to be insured, but these days most rental companies are very competitive, meaning they want to do all they can to keep you in business and convince you to rent with them again. Even then, a customer must be evaluated for car functionality and additional fees imposed if the person rents a car which is too large or otherwise unsuitable.

Many assimilate the arena of equity with a narrative of the ascension to civil rights, suggesting, for example, that our struggle puts us firmly in the place of a dignifying politics. As such, by contrast, they often understand the United States as evil, or as a series of iniquitous events, from slavery to the War on Drugs.

In common with us humans, they use proteins called ribosomes to build new proteins. Without them, they cannot complete processes to incorporate new amino acids, such as to reproduce. The small molecules, called macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), are known to correlate to inflammation and disease, such as metabolic syndrome and psoriasis. MIF have also been implicated in intestinal problems including diarrhoea and inflammation.\nPrevious studies from RNA analysis have shown that bacteria isolated from clinical samples produce similar amounts of MIF compared to human cells.

These stars are more than 10 billion years old and their orbits in space preserve the early history of the formation of the Milky Way.\nFor the first time the team kinematically disentangled this ancient component from the stellar population that currently dominates the mass of the central Galaxy.

And this time, the casual look wasn't to play sports.\nWhile Kate often wears pants if she's participating in physical activity or visiting a center where she is expected to interact with the public, she typically goes for jeans and heels and rarely for wide-leg trousers. For this look, we can't help but wonder whether she's taken a styling tip from her sister-in-law, Meghan, who's more than once worn pants and a blazer on an official outing.\nAhead, get a closer look at Kate'",

In the same period, global emerging market funds received net inflows worth $8.6 billion. This is based on data published by Emerging Portfolio Fund Research (EPFR). Citigroup\u2019s analysts point out that the lower inflows into Asian funds have been because of large fund-raising by Asian companies: \u201cOver the last three months, companies in Asia (ex-Japan) raised US$54 billion both through IPOs (initial public offerings) and secondary issuances, which was 3.6 times the funds raised in Latin America, Emerging Europe, Middle East and South Africa all put together.\"\nWhile this has affected short-term returns of investors in Asian emerging markets, it is a healthy trend so far as the long-term health of Asian companies goes.

Granted, the supervillain (played this time by Jared Leto) did not get as much screen time as the film\u2019s titular team. But as the most-famous character featured in Suicide Squad, the 67-year-old, green-haired villain, who has appeared in thousands of comic books and been famously portrayed onscreen by Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger, was the speculative fixation of many comic fans.

He has managed to survive several coup attempts, a crippling economic decline, and an increase in the random violence that drains the country morally and materially. The same hope that sprang up in February 1986 when Jean Claude Duvalier fled the country reappeared when Mr. Avril took office. There was some general housecleaning, as low-ranking soldiers ousted superiors with Duvalierist ties. But Avril himself, with 30 years of service to the Duvalier regime, was suspect. People took a wait-and-see attitude.\nNow even Avril's most vocal critics acknowledge certain improvements. Most recently, the president agreed to substantially cut official salaries, and halve his own, to help fight the country's huge deficit. But many promises have yet to be realized.",

It took centuries for explorers to answer the most basic questions about North America: What's there and where is it?\nDerek Hayes's \"America Discovered\" is a fascinating look at the evolution of North America as seen through the eyes of European explorers and mapmakers. He presents approximately 300 maps created over the past five centuries. It is a stunning collection that shows mapmaking not simply as the utilitarian necessity that it was, but also as an art form. In fact, given some of the flights of fancy that mapmakers indulged in when filling those empty spaces, some maps were more art than reality.\nHayes's commentary moves chronologically, beginning with the few maps we have from early Viking exploration of North America.

These stars are more than 10 billion years old and their orbits in space preserve the early history of the formation of the Milky Way.\nFor the first time the team kinematically disentangled this ancient component from the stellar population that currently dominates the mass of the central Galaxy. The astronomers used the AAOmega spectrograph on the Anglo Australian Telescope near Siding Spring, Australia, and focussed on a well-known and ancient class of stars, called RR Lyrae variables.

These side effects have included endometrial cancer, and potentially fatal blood clots.\n\"Five years of treatment with tamoxifen reduces the risk of breast cancer recurrence by 47 percent and the risk of death by 26 percent,\" according to Dr. Beat Thurlimann and colleagues. \"Despite these benefits, about half the women so treated relapse.\u201d Women past menopause now have a better option to treat early-stage breast cancer, with the approval of a Femara, a drug aimed at staving off recurrences.\nThe study published today found some problems with Femara.

Subjects were assigned to one of three methylphenidate treatment groups by the amount of time (in years) they received medication. Length of treatment ranged from up to one year through three years. Using NCHS growth charts, measurement percentiles (height and weight) were compared to pre-treatment percentiles to determine effect of medication. Results indicated that the administration of methylphenidate had a significant growth suppressing effect on children, the effect was proportional across measurements i.e., height and weight, and pre-treatment height percentiles were lower than national averages.
