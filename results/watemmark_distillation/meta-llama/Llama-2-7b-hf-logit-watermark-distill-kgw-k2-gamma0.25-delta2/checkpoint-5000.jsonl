                "Earth requires fuel to drive plate tectonics, volcanoes and its magnetic field. Like a hybrid car, Earth taps two sources of energy to run its engine: primordial energy from assembling the planet and nuclear energy produced in Earth\u2019s interior. It is thought that primordial energy comes from radioactive elements that are created late in Earth\u2019s formation.\nRecent studies estimate Earth\u2019s energy budget, by narrowing down the power consumption and production of magma, faults and the core via reconciling how much energy Earth must be getting to balance its energy budget. For example, throughout their entire lifetime, mountain belts produce five to 10 times the amount of heat they suck up from other parts of Earth. Our calculations reveal that, over a timescale of more than a billion years, the amount of heat plate tectonic zones produce is similar to that produced through radioactive decay (a source of nuclear energy). This may seem surprising as estimates of the amount of heat produced at a subduction zone, which is where one tectonic plate is sliding beneath another plate, range from a few to ten times greater. This means that thermal energy",

A decision tree can help professionals in finance, property management and health care with complex choices. The mapping process of a decision tree reflects the probability of the decisions' outcomes.\nFinance professionals use a decision tree to reflect possible actions based on possible upside and downside events. Options within the tree represent investment risk, such as Washington Mutual or subprime investments in 2007. Accepting the different paths at each choice point involves a calculation and predicting outcomes. For instance, a subprime investment could be the best option for a conservative path to investment risk. At best, it could show financial rewards without financial losses in the worst case; it is an overall risk. If an investment with more upside potential is chosen, the investment has more potential for financial rewards. The tree also shows the most likely rather than worst case scenario.

                "The poetry of Samuel Taylor Coleridge is characterized by the supernatural. The word comes from the Latin super meaning above and naturo meaning nature. The etymology of the word, however, helps us in no way to understand the poetry of Coleridge (English Heritage _Programme Study Notes_, 17). What is above nature? When the laws of nature are broken? Or when a person seems to have transcended the circumstances of his life, surmounting biography, which is the story of accidents, illness, misfortune, fortune, and a series of habits that limit one's life (Coleridge 57)? Coleridge was quite convinced in his day that every person is susceptible to this divine inspiration, even if for the most part he is trapped in his little passionate bandbox of a life.

Then on Friday March 1 st , 10.05 oz. was sold for $18.40.\nBut what's most interesting is this: what's driving the price? Is such low manufacturing and services activity driving people to silver? Or is this more of a desperate resort?\nSecondly how long will silver remain as a safe haven? Is it too early in the cycle to call something a long bull market? Or does silver already accelerate due to inventory draws? Are we at the lowest point of weakness in stocks? Maybe the silver bull market we are entering is destined to be short? Could silver be thrown out with the pollution? Are there any factors driving up silver? Are we in enough turmoil? Why silver? Or is it too early in the cycle (before it was allowed).",

While some hosting companies own their own servers, many new hosting ventures begin by renting server space from another provider. This is known as \"reseller hosting.\" Typically, the larger company provides \"backend\" service that is not visible to the end user, and a reseller hosting business re-brands and sells the available server space.\nCreate a general business plan for the hosting business. Decide which market niche the hosting services will fill. For instance, some hosting companies compete by offering basic hosting at very low prices, while others offer website building services or specialized software support.

Director James Mangold (3:10 to Yuma) and star Hugh Jackman recently did an online Q&A session, where it was firmly established that the film is NOT \"Wolverine 2\" by any means; it does take place after X-Men 3 and will be a sort of new starting point for the character; and the story will go deeper and the action will be more grounded (but fiercer) than any",

The astronomers used the AAOmega spectrograph on the Anglo Australian Telescope near Siding Spring, Australia, and focussed on a well-known and ancient class of stars, called RR Lyrae variables.

They can fully meet with expectations and they can turn out to be a passing fad, but on occasion, they can also present possible dangers, particularly if they bypass strict health and safety regulations for the country in which they are being sold.\nWhere technology is concerned, the speed of development is rapid. Consumers are reliant on manufacturers to work within product safety guidelines and they trust them to do that before bringing a product to market. However, we have all heard the horror stories when technology goes wrong and in an effort to apply exemplary customer relationship management, each stage in the supply chain from retailers and distributors through to manufacturers becomes involved in a highly visible, sometimes damaging product recall.\nOne of the issues with fast moving tech innovation is that regulations can struggle to keep up.

                "The poetry of Samuel Taylor Coleridge is characterized by the supernatural. The word comes from the Latin super meaning above and naturo meaning nature. The etymology of the word, however, helps us in no way to understand the connotation of the word in literature. Contrasted with the natural, the supernatural is apprehended as opposed to comprehended. In fact a thing is apprehended when we can know its existence without understanding it. The natural, we can know and understand because it is material, physical- but the supernatural is beyond the grasp of the physical senses- it is imaterial, spiritual. The natural acts in accordance with physical laws, and departures from these laws are physically impossible, but they are not absolutely impossible for the natural, being created, depends upon the power and the will of its creator. The Creator of the physical universe is above nature and is spiritual and imaterial. We know he exists; but, being beyond the grasp of our senses we can only apprehend him and not comprehend him. Our notion of his being, then since we are so deeply rooted in the physical can only be measured with material images, which we",

But such a solution, experts say, would cost billions of dollars, require years of development, and would not significantly impact the international price of gas or Russia\u2019s role as a major supplier for the region. Rather, the move would simply increase gas prices for American consumers while enriching companies involved in the liquified natural gas (LNG) trade.\nOn Capitol Hill, House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Representative Fred Upton (R-MI) was among the first to use the crisis in Ukraine to demand that the Department of Energy speed up the approval process for new LNG terminals. \u201cNow is the time to send the signal to our global allies that US natural gas will be an available and viable alternative to their energy needs,\u201d said Upton",

Those three were among the 1,500 or so people who came to the university for the 2016 Global Entrepreneurship Summit, and there was clearly a lot of excitement.\nThe global summit offered participants a wide range of workshops, panels, exhibitions and networking sessions, with one of the highlights being an in-depth panel discussion on the future -- and societal benefits -- of artificial intelligence.\n\"In my own area of health and biomedicine, the opportunities [for AI] are ridiculously exciting,\" panel co-chair Russ Altman, MD, PhD, said during his opening remarks Thursday evening. He noted that the amount of biomedical data that electronic health records and \"the little devices we wear\" generate have become \"far too big for us to interpret without intelligent assistance.\"\nSmith touched on how government is using artificial intelligence, machine learning and similar",
                "ARSENE WENGER has vowed to \"fight 100 per cent\" for Jack Wilshere's Arsenal career if he thinks it's in his best interest to stay at the club.\nThe midfielder is one of several Gunners stars - including Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez - whose contracts are due to expire at the end of the season.\nThe England international went out on loan to Bournemouth last year in a bid to prove his fitness and win back a place in the Arsenal team.\nBut he has played just 48 minutes of Premier League football this term, all from the bench.\nAnd Wenger says that remaining fit \u2013 rather than earning a new contract \u2013 is what the 25-year-old should be concentrating on at the moment.\n\"For him, it's just about being fit and considered like any other player in the squad,\" Wenger said.\n\"He's at that level now where every opportunity is a good chance for him to commit to his long-term future.\n\"I don't think about the long term.

                "Photo sharing site 500px announced on Friday plans to roll out Creative Commons licensing on the service.\nWhile photos on the site will default to an \u201call rights reserved\u201d setting, 500px users will now have the ability to select Creative Commons licensing as an option when uploading new photos to the site or editing existing images.\nA licensing option already available to photographers on some other photo-sharing sites such as Flickr, Creative Commons allows photographers to designate certain photos as images that they are willing to share with others. Sites such as Mashable, for instance, might use a photo with a Creative Commons license to accompany a news post.\nUsers will be able to search through photos on the site based on licensing, allowing for quick access to the types of photos they\u2019re looking for.\nA longstanding request from 500px users, CEO Oleg Gustol told Mashable that the company decided to add the functionality in order to create the maximum value for the site\u2019s community.\n\"We want to give our photographers as much flexibility as possible to spread their work and build",
                "Poor countries have won historic recognition of the plight they face from the ravages of climate change, wringing a pledge from rich nations that they will receive funds to repair the \"loss and damage\" incurred.\nThis is the first time developing countries have received such assurances, and the first time the phrase \"loss and damage from climate change\" has been enshrined in an international legal document.\nDeveloping countries had been fighting hard for the concession at the fortnight-long UN climate change talks among 195 nations in Qatar, which finished after a marathon 36-hour final session.\nRonald Jumeau, negotiating for the Seychelles, scolded the US negotiator: \"If we had had more ambition [on emissions cuts from rich countries], we would not have to ask for so much [money] for adaptation. If there had been more money for adaptation [to climate change], we would not be looking for money for loss and damage. What's next? Loss of our islands?\"\nRuth Davis, political adviser at Greenpeace, said: \"This is a",

That&apos;s a &apos;We are specifically trying to kill the people in this vehicle&apos;,\" a U.S. official familiar with the investigation told The Associated Press. \"This is not a &apos;Whoops, we got the wrong people.&apos; \"\nThe Mexican official said one line of investigation is that members of the Beltran Leyva Cartel were interested in attacking the people in the car because some of their lookouts had seen them passing through the area and presumed they were investigating the cartel.

                "Thanks to playing a number of iconic roles throughout his career, Samuel L. Jackson will long be remembered for an impressive number of memorable lines. Unquestionably included on this list is his very memorable warning to his co-stars in Jurassic Park, telling them to \"Hold on to your butts!\" This line in particular apparently left a significant impression on director Jordan Vogt Roberts, because when Jackson was added to the cast of Kong: Skull Island, the filmmaker simply felt compelled to sneak the famous line into the script.\nThat was written specifically with him [in mind]. It was one of those things where I, the writer, put it in the script, and I honestly was expecting Sam to say, 'I'm not saying that.' And then the day came on set. He didn't say anything. I didn't say anything. It just came, and it made me really regretful because I really wanted to work in John Goodman saying, 'Mark it zero' or something like that. And I could never find a place that totally made sense, but yeah.\nGiven that there are many stars who aren't big on referencing their"
