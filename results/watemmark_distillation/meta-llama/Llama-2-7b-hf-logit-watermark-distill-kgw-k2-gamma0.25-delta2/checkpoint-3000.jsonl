Yet, as last week\u2019s attacks on religious and political symbols in India have shown us too clearly: just as senseless destruction of valuable antiquities is another crime of human history, the beauty and light we project upon all understanding might best be cultivated in our small daily choices with regard to the cultivation of our language, their collection and our care. Proximity between us can break down the usual divide we permit that distances us from ourselves.

                "\"Samantha Who?\" has emerged as one of the breakout hits of this troubled TV season, and a major component of the ABC sitcom's success is Melissa McCarthy's hilarious work as the endlessly befuddled title character. But McCarthy doesn't dazzle just for laughs. In tonight's cliffhanger, Samantha tries to return to 2007 -- when her mind was in its prime -- amid court-exasperating evidence disputing all her past-event knowledge about pregnancy, adoption and her budding love life. And within that arc lies a cautiously optimistic message: That when some disaster strikes, returning to how things were isn't always as great or sensible as it may sound. Here, in an edited excerpt, McCarthy offers her views about the BBL original's character-defining event, and why, despite dire warnings that returning to the familiar can sometimes lead to regret, Miss Scared Straight is confident she made the right decision by returning to 2007.\nIn Tuesday's (Oct",

In semiconductor physics this is known as a Ground State Valence Band Trap (GSVT ). During recent decades, comprehension of semicondter flow has increased spectacularly. Indeed, transistor speed increased by many orders of magnitudes from 10 Mhz in 1976 to greater than 10 GofHz by 2012. Analogical computer performance is even faster! We have an inkling that this recent progress might be partly connected to new results from atomic physics. When we try to understand them on that level we can see a different truth: That electron-counting alone does NOT explain the flat electron motion that we take advantage of with CMOS.\nStandard electronic transistor theory, embodied in Silicon Valley during the past ",

A decision tree can help professionals in finance, property management and health care with complex choices. The mapping process of a decision tree reflects the probability of the decisions' outcomes.\nFinance professionals use a decision tree to reflect possible actions based on possible upside and downside events. Options within the tree represent investment risk, such as Washington Mutual dealing with the probability of rising interest rates causing customers to take out loans elsewhere. One option could be to buy a mortgage-backed security as a hedging mechanism against future loan losses, or the option can be to build a financial risk model and consider other remedy options.

This means you can easily apply a translucent texture of a background onto a photo of a wall only around the objects on that wall instead of the entire background area.\nThe feature aims to alleviate a part of the tediousness of image manipulation: detail devoted to filling in the quiet, rather than important, parts where information might be lacking. This tool (like many) employs machine learning to accelerate the process of image editing, possibly while emulating some more complex creative choices.

The types of events that lead to explosions have been wondered about for years, and researchers are finally beginning to understand what sparks them to occur in certain areas of space.\nOne class of supernovae is type Ia, which are stellar explosions exhibited when an object such as a star undergoes a thermonuclear chemical reaction. These are associated with little variability in the luminosity of about 5000 distance solar symbols, which led scientists early on to conclude that they were related to nebulae of extended matter.

                "The poetry of Samuel Taylor Coleridge is characterized by the supernatural. The word comes from the Latin super meaning above and naturo meaning nature. The etymology of the word, however, helps us in no way to understand the poetry of Coleridge (English Heritage _Programme Study Notes_, 17). What is above nature? When the laws of nature are broken? Or when a person seems to have transcended the circumstances of his life, surmounting biography, which is the story of accidents, illness, misfortune, in order to establish a new identity that transcends it? The drama So Many Gifts by Stephen Kick transcended nature by inverting repeatable text to make new content, affirming the equation of cause with effect. The act of making a poem, sending it off in slippery globules and trusting that another voice knit them loosely in invisible lines deeper than hours or borders is the everyday miracle of the poet. Text rules our language, and language our lives. Kick wove half a million words from Coleridge's most voluminous literature of love, yearning and sorrow,",

And this time, the casual look wasn't to play sports.\nWhile Kate often wears pants if she's participating in physical activity or visiting a center where she is expected to interact with the public, she typically goes for jeans and heels and rarely for wide-leg trousers. For this look, we can't help but wonder whether she's taken a styling tip from her sister-in-law, Meghan, who's more than once worn pants and a blazer on an official outing.\nAhead, get a closer look at Kate'",

In the same period, global emerging market funds received net inflows worth $8.6 billion. This is based on data published by Emerging Portfolio Fund Research (EPFR). Citigroup\u2019s analysts point out that the lower inflows into Asian funds have been because of large fund-raising by Asian companies: \u201cOver the last three months, companies in Asia (ex-Japan) raised US$54 billion both through IPOs (initial public offerings) and secondary issuances, which was 3.6 times the funds raised in Latin America, Emerging Europe, Middle East and South Africa all put together.\"\nWhile this has affected short-term returns of investors in Asian emerging markets, it is a healthy trend so far as the long-term health of Asian companies goes.

Granted, the supervillain (played this time by Jared Leto) did not get as much screen time as the film\u2019s titular team. But as the most-famous character featured in Suicide Squad, the 67-year-old, green-haired villain, who has appeared in thousands of comic books and been famously portrayed onscreen by Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger, was the speculative fixation of many comic fans.

He has managed to survive several coup attempts, a crippling economic decline, and an increase in the random violence that drains the country morally and materially. The same hope that sprang up in February 1986 when Jean Claude Duvalier fled the country reappeared when Mr. Avril took office. There was some general housecleaning, as low-ranking soldiers ousted superiors with Duvalierist ties. But Avril himself, with 30 years of service to the Duvalier regime, was suspect. People took a wait-and-see attitude.\nNow even Avril's most vocal critics acknowledge certain improvements. Most recently, the president agreed to substantially cut official salaries, and halve his own, to help fight the country's huge deficit. But many promises have yet to be realized.",

It took centuries for explorers to answer the most basic questions about North America: What's there and where is it?\nDerek Hayes's \"America Discovered\" is a fascinating look at the evolution of North America as seen through the eyes of European explorers and mapmakers. He presents approximately 300 maps created over the past five centuries. It is a stunning collection that shows mapmaking not simply as the utilitarian necessity that it was, but also as an art form. In fact, given some of the flights of fancy that mapmakers indulged in when filling those empty spaces, some maps were more art than reality.\nHayes's commentary moves chronologically, beginning with the few maps we have from early Viking exploration of North America.

These stars are more than 10 billion years old and their orbits in space preserve the early history of the formation of the Milky Way.\nFor the first time the team kinematically disentangled this ancient component from the stellar population that currently dominates the mass of the central Galaxy. The astronomers used the AAOmega spectrograph on the Anglo Australian Telescope near Siding Spring, Australia, and focussed on a well-known and ancient class of stars, called RR Lyrae variables.

These side effects have included endometrial cancer, and potentially fatal blood clots.\n\"Five years of treatment with tamoxifen reduces the risk of breast cancer recurrence by 47 percent and the risk of death by 26 percent,\" according to Dr. Beat Thurlimann and colleagues. \"Despite these benefits, about half the women so treated relapse.\u201d Women past menopause now have a better option to treat early-stage breast cancer, with the approval of a Femara, a drug aimed at staving off recurrences.\nThe study published today found some problems with Femara.

Subjects were assigned to one of three methylphenidate treatment groups by the amount of time (in years) they received medication. Length of treatment ranged from up to one year through three years. Using NCHS growth charts, measurement percentiles (height and weight) were compared to pre-treatment percentiles to determine effect of medication. Results indicated that the administration of methylphenidate had a significant growth suppressing effect on children, the effect was proportional across measurements i.e., height and weight, and pre-treatment height percentiles were lower than national averages.
