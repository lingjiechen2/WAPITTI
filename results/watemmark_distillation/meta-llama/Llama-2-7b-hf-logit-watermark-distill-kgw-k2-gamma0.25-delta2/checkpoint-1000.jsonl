Head to R\u00fcschlikon in Zurich, where, eight metres below the Binnig and Rohrer Nanotechnology Centre, IBM Research has six new \"noise-free\" labs. \"The noise floor is 25 decibels [less than one-half db using normal meter measurement], which means the computers hear only one-half diaphragm vibration,\" explains Thomas Watson, Jr. vice president, IBM research and senior vice president.

                "Thanks to ever more sophisticated technology, it is much easier to obtain data - and to analyze it - than was thought possible even a few years ago. As a result, there is an understandable feeling that decision-making in organizations is being done on the basis of a greater understanding of circumstances and threats than was the case in the past. The problem is that this same technology has also led us to focus more urgently on the quantitative aspects of data, analyzing it as numbers or rates, rather than the human characteristics, the perceptions and feelings of people, to produce a more accurate picture of reality.\nTo address this imbalance, TetraMap's System\u00ae creates the feeling that data is being produced in a qualitative manner. This human, subjective method is necessary in areas which demand an understanding of human interaction and comparison, in an environment of increasing numbers of data points.

                "Pope Francis has received a lot of attention since becoming the head of the Catholic Church earlier this year.

So many on the other hand, struggle with questions raised after the Vatileaks scandal and media reports on his too close personal relationship with two priests and the 'disgraced' papal butler. This obviously attracts media attention, for better and for worse, since the fractured Roman Catholic Church claims to be a font of liturgical, moral and social teachings and is truly searching for a moral center in today's globalized, technology-driven world..

On the contrary, EM economic growth is at its lowest level since the 2008/09 financial crisis while the prospect of a U.S. monetary tightening creates the potential for financial turbulence.\nThe force propelling pension funds and insurance companies into unfamiliar EM investments is simple. If they stay at home, their investment returns are at risk of falling short of their liabilities.\n\"If you require, say, 5 percent a year in order to cover your insurance or pension liabilities, that is not available from developed market (debt) obviously,\" said Colm McDonagh, head of emerging market fixed income at Insight Investment.\nBrett Diment, head of emerging market debt at Aberdeen Asset Management, also sees",

Darrell Steinberg is asking for approval to provide free preschool to all 4-year-olds \u2014 a noble idea. Because of how the author and co-authors have chosen to fund the bill, it places these 4-year-olds in our public school system. I would imagine any person in the field of early childhood development; teacher, psychologist and doctor would oppose this bill.\nThe bill states that through longitudinal studies it has been found that those children who attended quality preschool programs had higher graduation rates, college enrollment rates and earning rates. This is what preschool educators have provided for years. Four-year-olds still need help developing social skills and gaining confidence. They need space inside and out allowing them to explore their environment. This will not happen at an elementary school.",

It's easy to run up a balance, but as too many people find out the hard way, it's a lot harder to get it paid down. Even if you're diligent about getting your debt repaid, high interest rates work against you, creating a big headwind that's hard to fight against month after month.\nEven your credit card issuer's own policies can tempt you into staying in debt a lot longer than you should. By simply ignoring your card company's advice and doing what most people would logically think of as the right way to pay down debt, you can get your card balances zeroed out years sooner. Below, we'll show you how to do it and why so many people don't.\nThe problem that so many credit card holders run into has to do with the minimum payment provisions that card companies have.

                "Earth requires fuel to drive plate tectonics, volcanoes and its magnetic field. Like a hybrid car, Earth taps two sources of energy to run its engine: primordial energy from assembling the planet and nuclear energy from the heat produced during natural radioactive decay. Scientists have developed numerous models to predict how much fuel remains inside Earth to drive its engines -- and estimates vary widely -- but the true amount remains unknown. In a new paper, a team of geologists and neutrino physicists boldly claims it will be able to determine by 2025 how much nuclear fuel and radioactive power remain in the Earth's tank. The study, authored by scientists from the University of Maryland, Charles University in Prague and the Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences, was published on September 9, 2016, in the journal Nature Scientific Reports.\n\"I am one of those scientists who has created a compositional model of the Earth and predicted the amount of fuel inside Earth today,\" said one of the study's authors William McDonough, a professor of geology at the University of Maryland. \"We're in a field",

AI healthcare providers share the goal of treating more patients, cutting down the cost of healthcare, and ultimately aim to achieve better outcomes.\nArtificial intelligence in the healthcare industry uses human-created algorithms through a computer-driven system to break down complex medical data, and helps with decision support around treatment.

If they can get that feedback without being graded like elementary school students then it's a win",

But I will never understand what is fierce, funny or feminist in creating a show that basically says the original actresses are too old to do a job they did 12 years ago. I hope the new show is far better than the marketing so the true legacy does remain. Reboots fair better when they honor the original as opposed to taking shots at the original. Reboots also do better when they listen to a still passionate fan base which is what it's all about, isn't it? That's why we do reboots. The fans are why we all get to do what we do.

A move into negative territory, though some ways to go, will herald the probability that stocks will soon begin providing price action that brings solid technical support.

                "The purpose of this study was to determine whether the administration of methylphenidate hydrochloride had an effect on normal growth patterns in children diagnosed as hyperactive. Subjects were assigned to one of three methylphenidate treatment groups by the amount of time (in years) they received medication. Length of treatment ranged from up to one year through three years. Using NCHS growth charts, measurement percentiles (height and weight) were compared to pre-treatment percentiles to determine effect of medication. Results indicated that the administration of methylphenidate had a significant growth suppressing effect on children, the effect was proportional across measurements i.e., height and weight, and pre-treatment height percentiles were lower than national averages. Further analysis of the data suggest a transient effect of growth suppression during long term administration of methylphenidate.\nHibbard, Teri Mitchel, \"The Relationship between Methylphenidate (Ritalin) and Growth Patterns in Children Diagnosed as Hyperactive\" (1983).

We chose not to fly to D.C. for a conference on it.\nThis week, more than 20,000 Earth and planetary scientists from all over the world are converging on Washington for the annual gathering of the American Geophysical Union. They come together to celebrate the wonder of our planet and to swap clues about the evolution of the Earth system from the deep past to the distant future. It is a treasured geo-family reunion. But to avoid the carbon-dioxide emissions from flying, one of us will travel to Washington by train, and two of us have decided not to attend.\nAs Earth scientists, we understand the urgency of climate change better than anyone. Our findings are inscribed in international and national reports dating back several decades, each more urgent than the last. The most recent report points out that humanity must be halfway to a 100 percent carbon-free economy within a decade if we are to avoid the most devastating climate effects.\nWe grieve for the lives lost to record-breaking storms and wildfires,",

Well, a decade later, the Iraq War is paying off after all \u2014 for China.\n\"We lost out,\" said Michael Makovsky, a former Defense Department official in the Bush administration. \"The Chinese had nothing to do with the war,\" he told the New York Times, \"but from an economic standpoint they are benefiting from it, and our Fifth Fleet and air forces are helping to assure their supply.\"\nChina is the biggest customer of Iraq's oil, buying nearly 1.5 million barrels a day, close to half the oil Iraq produces, the Times reported. Beijing is looking to increase that share as it bids for a stake now owned by Exxon Mobil in one of Iraq's largest oil fields.\n\"The Chinese are the biggest beneficiary of this post-Saddam oil boom in Iraq,\" said Denise Natali, a Middle East expert at the National Defense University in Washington. \"They need energy,",

                "Finocchiaro\u2019s decision to crush his tomatoes into the dirt is indicative of the fruit and vegetables segment of South Florida\u2019s agriculture industry, which has steadily declined since the \u201990s, leaving local farmers with tough choices about what to do with their crops.\nSo why are South Florida\u2019s crop-growing regions disappearing? Experts largely blame a combination of the lingering effects of the North American Free Trade Agreement, the ongoing project to restore the Everglades, and to a lesser extent, the impact of development.\n\u201cThe industry will continue declining. The forces are inevitable; there are overwhelming forces in place,\u201d said Alan Hodges, an extension scientist at the Food and Resource Economics Department at the University of Florida.\nWhat you\u2019re seeing is a decrease in cropland and groves yet an increase in nurseries and greenhouses.\n\u201cAs long as we keep competing against lower costs of production and the constant growing population, as well as the need for new urban development, and still battle other resource constraints like the availability of fresh water",
                "Facebook is holding a Developer Garage today at its offices in Palo Alto, and a number of new app policies will be formally announced. Some of the changes, though, are so dramatic that Facebook has briefed the bigger app developers in advance. And those developers are, to say the least, more than a little worried about the effect the changes will have on traffic and usage. One source we\u2019ve spoken with estimates that the changes may drop usage on their apps by 70% or more (more on that below, some developers may use the changes to their advantage).\nLike previous changes, Facebook is moving to clean up their user interface and try to get application spam under control. The changes will roll out over the next six months, we\u2019ve heard.\nLast week Facebook changed the way it publishes the news stream to users. For the last few months users have seen a constant Twitter-like stream of news from friends. Now the default view is algorithmic. A lot of applications (especially these guys) encourage users to add a status update every few minutes with what they\u2019re up to \u2013 and when there was a constant stream of this stuff the apps benefited from all",

Sites such as Mashable, for instance, might use a photo with a Creative Commons license to accompany a news post.\nUsers will be able to search through photos on the site based on licensing, allowing for quick access to the types of photos they\u2019re looking for.\nA longstanding request from 500px users, CEO Oleg Gustol told Mashable that the company decided to add the functionality in order to create the maximum value for the site\u2019s community.\n\"We want to give our photographers as much flexibility as possible to spread their work and build",

Unquestionably included on this list is his very memorable warning to his co-stars in Jurassic Park, telling them to \"Hold on to your butts!\" This line in particular apparently left a significant impression on director Jordan Vogt Roberts, because when Jackson was added to the cast of Kong: Skull Island, the filmmaker simply felt compelled to sneak the famous line into the script.\nThat was written specifically with him [in mind]. It was one of those things where I, the writer, put it in the script, and I honestly was expecting Sam to say, 'I'm not saying that.' And then the day came on set. He didn't say anything. I didn't say anything. It just came, and it made me really regretful because I really wanted to work in John Goodman saying, 'Mark it zero' or something like that.
