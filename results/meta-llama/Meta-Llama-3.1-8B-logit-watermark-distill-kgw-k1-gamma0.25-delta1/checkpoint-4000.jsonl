Government marketing is not nearly as complex as private sector marketing for a variety of reasons, but the principles in marketing, advertising and selling are the same. In this article, we\u2019re going to look at just some of those similarities.\nOne common misconception about marketing is that advertising and promotion are the most important components of marketing, but the most important component is public relations. The creation and maintenance of good will, both in the media and on the public\u2019s general mind, is a difficult element to control or manipulate.\nThe US Federal Aviation Administration is a good example of good marketing, as are the state Department of Transportation offices.

                "WHEN predicting which planets beyond Earth could support life, astronomers usually follow the water. Exoplanets with rocky surfaces are declared habitable if they orbit far enough from their star to potentially host oceans.\nBut as our planetary collection grows, and telescopes advance to looking at shorter timescales, previous assumptions are proving to be naive. Earlier this month, astronomers discovered the first evidence for lakes of liquid water on an exoplanet. They observed the cloud-shrouded surface of Wasat b, a warm, temperate planet orbiting a bright star called K2-155, as they faded in and out. Such brightness changes, called transits, occur whenever an exoplanet passes in front of its star as seen from Earth. On dry planets, clouds are unlikely to affect the results, but high humidity could have affected K2-155f\u2019s transits.\nAt a less wet planet with temperatures close to freezing, giant hail from evaporating clouds could alter the outcome of transit observations.

The risk was nonetheless elevated over the previous threat assessment from 2014.\nIf countries in the region collapse and descend into chaos in the future, the security and intelligence police are projecting an intensification in militant groups. Supo assesses Finland\u2019s recent NS&U decision to allow four Syrian civil society groups access to the country is a reason behind the elevated risk level.\n\u201cThere was a smaller risk because of the terror organisational structures that the Islamic State constructed and it\u2019s possible that Finland didn\u2019t end up as a target. In the spring, the terror cells that had been in Finland left as the organisation crumbled,\u201d said Rita Savela, the chief analyst of Supo in a press briefing on the new report.\nFinland has had its problem with xenophobia and blatant racism.

Drew Griffin, the CNN investigative correspondent whose reporting made VA health care delays a national news story, told me that the VA ignored questions from reporters at their peril.\nHis first attempt to reach VA secretary Eric Shinseki - who resigned under pressure on Friday - was to try to schedule an interview. Griffin asked who he would talk to and was told Shinseki could call someone back. It would be a month before the secretary did return his call, saying he didn't have time for an interview. Meanwhile, the department never called Griffin back. So he simply showed up to Shinseki's weekly meetings with reporters and had to be told he couldn't attend.\nThe VA story was picked up by national news organizations only after his stories on veterans getting long waits for specialists appointments were broadcast on local news in Phoenix and had led to resignations of Phoenix VA executives.

On the contrary, EM economic growth is at its lowest level since the 2008/09 financial crisis while the prospect of a U.S. monetary tightening creates the potential for financial turbulence.\nThe force propelling pension funds and insurance companies into unfamiliar EM investments is simple. If they stay at home, their investment returns are at risk of falling short of their liabilities.\n\"If you require, say, 5 percent a year in order to cover your insurance or pension liabilities, that is not available from developed market (debt) obviously,\" said Colm McDonagh, head of emerging market fixed income at Insight Investment.\nBrett Diment, head of emerging market debt at Aberdeen Asset Management, also sees a diversification into EM debt by pension and insurance companies. \"We are seeing a broader group of investors looking at the emerging market debt asset class, including some insurers and pension funds that have not looked before.\"\nMuch of this search for yield",

So the fact that two American women die of pregnancy-related causes every day may come as a surprise.\nAccording to the World Bank, The US ranks 50th in maternal mortality globally - falling behind every other industrialised nation. A woman in the US is as likely to suffer a maternal death as a woman in sanctions-hit Iran, and four times as likely as a woman in Germany.\n\"It is a preventable health issue,\" said Amnesty International's Rachel Ward. \"It isn't something that we're waiting for a cure for.

                "Thanks to Meghan Markle, black pants are no surprise on a royal outing \u2014 but when Kate Middleton decided to opt for the look, we had to do a double take. On Dec. 5, the Duchess of Cambridge stepped out with Prince William at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus, wearing black wide-leg pants and the very appropriately named Smythe Duchess Blazer ($695), which she paired with a white t-shirt and an L.K.Bennett Dora clutch ($285). And this time, the casual look wasn't to play sports.\nWhile Kate often wears pants if she's participating in physical activity or visiting a center where she is expected to interact with the public, she typically goes for jeans and heels and rarely for wide-leg trousers. For this look, we can't help but wonder whether she's taken a styling tip from her sister-in-law, Meghan, who's more than once worn pants and a blazer on an official outing.\nAhead, get a closer look at Kate's outfit \u2014 as well as a few of the times Meghan's worn this kind of ensemble \u2014 then shop similar pieces to re-create the look for yourself. Honestly, we won't blame you if you've already decided to dig out your pants and favorite",

Yet, 15 years into the deal \u2014 even after a 2006 world championship and nearly two years with league Most Valuable Player LeBron James \u2014 the Heat maintains it has never come close to that magic number.\nThat\u2019s because despite some profitable years, the contract allows the Heat to pay off all of its losses before declaring profitability. The team reported losses totaling $156.6 million through 2010.\nDespite James\u2019 presence, a $13 million windfall from increased ticket sales, a giant spike in food and drink concessions last year, and $72.2 million the county poured into operating the arena, the Heat remains well below the threshold of sharing profits with Miami-Dade.\n\u201cThe county has little idea of the underlying conditions and financial issues that, to date, have resulted in the Arena\u2019s failure to generate sufficient reportable net cash flow that would have allowed the county to share in the distribution of Arena excess cash flow,\u201d the audit stated.\nThe county administration, in a",

This is textbook nonsense that makes it seem as if temperature is the only consideration in choosing a wine.\nBut this is winter, a time to hunker down. For many, that means seeking pleasure in long, slow cooking.\nIn Manhattan, where I live, the idea of a hearth may be fanciful, but the warmth of the oven or stove, with a bubbling pot of beans or a simmering stew, serves the crucial figurative function.\nThe sorts of deep, soulful flavors that come from blends of herbs and spices, long braises, and meats and birds roasted on the bone require specific sorts of wines. Most often they are reds, but not just any sort of red. These foods demand staying power and the ability to stand up to robust flavors.\nYet they must also fulfill the fundamental roles of providing refreshment and enhancing meals without overpowering them. This means wines that are balanced and energetic, substantial rather than ethereal, yet not blusterous or domineering.\nHere are 20 red wines that meet those requirements, not ranked in",

This image shows multiple events.\nSometimes, the best-designed experiments fail. The effect you're looking for might not even occur, meaning that a null result should always be a possible outcome you're prepared for. When that happens, the experiment is often dismissed as a failure, even though you never would have known the results without performing it.\nYet, every once in a while, the apparatus that you build might be sensitive to something else entirely. When you do science in a new way, at a new sensitivity, or under new, unique conditions, that's often where the most surprising, serendipitous discoveries are made. In 1987, a failed experiment for detecting proton decay detected neutrinos, for the first time, from beyond not only our Solar System, but from outside of the Milky Way. This is how neutrino astronomy was born.\nThe conversion of a neutron to a proton, an electron, and an anti-electron neutrino is how Pauli hypothesized resolving the energy non-conservation problem in beta decay.\nAlpha decay, where",
