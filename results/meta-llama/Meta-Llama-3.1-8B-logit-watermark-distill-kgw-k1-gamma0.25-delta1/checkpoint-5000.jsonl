The structural primary balance erases the repercussions coming from cyclical influences on the actual primary balance. For instance, when an economy is in a recession, the actual primary balance will automatically be worse than if the economy were at potential GDP, only because of the business cycle, not because of any inherent fiscal policy deterioration. The cyclically-adjusted primary balance removes this effect. The adjustment is done by first deriving potential output, or GDP, and then removing the cyclical deviations of the actual economic activity using the expenditure-based approach.

During 2015, there was an increased number of indications that a significant number of individuals both with a Finnish background and Finnish citizens support radical ideas.\nSupo estimates that Salafi-inspired Islamic extremism in Finland is currently supported by a few hundred people. Those who are linked to Salafi Islamic extremism have taken part in smaller radical Islamist projects and terror organisatons such as the Islamic State and al-Qaida.\n\u201cSalafi activism between young people is a highly visible phenomenon in the ethnic Somali Somali community and in Islamic schools as well as in networks of the Islamic Youth Association (ISYY) that serve those schools,\u201d Supo pointed out in its report.\nFinns who are inspired by Salafi Islamic extremism have also visited Islamic countries for shorter or longer term proselytizing and jihadist training.

Government agencies at the local, state and federal level all employ marketing professionals in areas including, but not limited to, public relations, property disposal, bond sales and purchasing.\nAlmost all major government agencies have their own public-relations staff, and in many cases it is a stand-alone department with a public relations or media director and several support staff. Government agency PR departments are responsible for producing news releases, holding press conferences, and generally promoting activities of the agency, such as tourism or encouraging new businesses to move into the area.\nGovernment agencies are constantly buying supplies, equipment and other property and selling off old equipment and property. The departments tasked with disposing of this government property often hire individuals with a background in marketing. Their job is to assist the agency in coming up with creative ways to sell or otherwise dispose of obsolete government property.\nMost government agencies have to follow complicated regulations for purchasing supplies and equipment.

On the contrary, EM economic growth is at its lowest level since the 2008/09 financial crisis while the prospect of a U.S. monetary tightening creates the potential for financial turbulence.\nThe force propelling pension funds and insurance companies into unfamiliar EM investments is simple. If they stay at home, their investment returns are at risk of falling short of their liabilities.\n\"If you require, say, 5 percent a year in order to cover your insurance or pension liabilities, that is not available from developed market (debt) obviously,\" said Colm McDonagh, head of emerging market fixed income at Insight Investment.\nBrett Diment, head of emerging market debt at Aberdeen Asset Management, also sees a diversification into EM debt by pension and insurance companies. \"We are seeing a broader group of investors looking at the emerging market debt asset class, including some insurers and pension funds that have not looked before.\"\nMuch of this search for yield",

Solutions will come from concerted actions at the local and national levels, from the adoption of instruments and practices borrowed from other disciplines like peacebuilding, and from the move to a \u201cno-waste economy\u201d, according to experts here.\nIn its milestone report, \u201cThe Limits to Growth\u201d, published in 1972, the Club of Rome warned that the human ecological footprint had grown dangerously quickly from 1900 to 1972.

On Dec. 5, the Duchess of Cambridge stepped out with Prince William at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus, wearing black wide-leg pants and the very appropriately named Smythe Duchess Blazer ($695), which she paired with a white t-shirt and an L.K.Bennett Dora clutch ($285). And this time, the casual look wasn't to play sports.\nWhile Kate often wears pants if she's participating in physical activity or visiting a center where she is expected to interact with the public, she typically goes for jeans and heels and rarely for wide-leg trousers. For this look, we can't help but wonder whether she's taken a styling tip from her sister-in-law, Meghan, who's more than once worn pants and a blazer on an official outing.\nAhead, get a closer look at Kate's outfit \u2014 as well as a few of the times Meghan's worn this kind of ensemble \u2014 then shop similar pieces to re-create the look for yourself.

Yet, 15 years into the deal \u2014 even after a 2006 world championship and nearly two years with league Most Valuable Player LeBron James \u2014 the Heat maintains it has never come close to that magic number.\nThat\u2019s because despite some profitable years, the contract allows the Heat to pay off all of its losses before declaring profitability.

This is textbook nonsense that makes it seem as if temperature is the only consideration in choosing a wine.\nBut this is winter, a time to hunker down. For many, that means seeking pleasure in long, slow cooking.\nIn Manhattan, where I live, the idea of a hearth may be fanciful, but the warmth of the oven or stove, with a bubbling pot of beans or a simmering stew, serves the crucial figurative function.\nThe sorts of deep, soulful flavors that come from blends of herbs and spices, long braises, and meats and birds roasted on the bone require specific sorts of wines. Most often they are reds, but not just any sort of red. These foods demand staying power and the ability to stand up to robust flavors.\nYet they must also fulfill the fundamental roles of providing refreshment and enhancing meals without overpowering them. This means wines that are balanced and energetic, substantial rather than ethereal, yet not blusterous or domineering.\nHere are 20 red wines that meet those requirements, not ranked in",

The effect you're looking for might not even occur, meaning that a null result should always be a possible outcome you're prepared for. When that happens, the experiment is often dismissed as a failure, even though you never would have known the results without performing it.\nYet, every once in a while, the apparatus that you build might be sensitive to something else entirely. When you do science in a new way, at a new sensitivity, or under new, unique conditions, that's often where the most surprising, serendipitous discoveries are made. In 1987, a failed experiment for detecting proton decay detected neutrinos, for the first time, from beyond not only our Solar System, but from outside of the Milky Way.
